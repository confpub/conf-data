In such videos, the instructor’s hands often hide the work area. In this demo, we present a diminished hand for visualizing the work area hidden by hands by capturing the work area with multiple cameras. To achieve the diminished reality, we use a light field rendering technique, in which light rays avoid passing through penalty points set in the unstructured light fields reconstructed from the multiple viewpoint images.",

It moves at a constant pace specified in advance by them, and its motion synchronizes the user’s one. People can always visually check the pace by looking at it as a personal pacemaker. They are also motivated to keep running by regarding it as a jogging companion. Moreover, proposed method overcomes safety problem of AR apps. Its most body parts are transparent so that it doesn’t obstruct their view. This study, thus, may contribute to augment daily jogging experience.",

            "Abstract": "Redirected walking (RDW) promises to allow near-natural walking in an infinitely large virtual environment (VE) by subtle manipulations of the virtual camera. Previous experiments showed that a physical radius of at least 22 meters is required for undetectable RDW. However, we found that it is possible to decrease this radius and to apply RDW to room-scale VR, i.,e., up to approximately $5$m,$times$,$5$m. This is done by using curved paths in the VE instead of straight paths, and by coupling them together in a way that enables continuous walking. Furthermore, the corresponding paths in the real world are laid out in a way that fits perfectly into room-scale VR. In this research demo, users can experience RDW in a room-scale head-mounted display VR setup and explore a VE of approximately $25$m,$times$,$25$m.",

            "Abstract": "This research demonstration presents an Immersive Virtual Substation for Electricians Training. A substation is one of the most critical facilities of the electrical distribution system, so it is mandatory to keep its normal operation to deliver high standards of service, power quality and avoid blackouts to consumers. Therefore, it is necessary to give an effective training to the electricians who will operate the equipment in the substation and to prepare them to face emergencies on daily basis. The main purpose of the proposed Immersive Virtual Environment is to provide a realistic experience to trainees in a safe environment where they can interact with equipment, explore the facility and, mainly, practice basic and complex maneuvers to recover substation operations. Users can interact with this Immersive Virtual Environment using HMDs, joysticks or even an ordinary keyboard, mouse and monitor. Feedback from trainees and instructors who used the Immersive Virtual Environment was very positive, indicating that the objectives were fully achieved.",

            "Abstract": "Vibrotactile feedback is broadly used to support different tasks in virtual and augmented reality applications, such as navigation, communication, attentional redirection, or to enhance the sense of presence in virtual environments. Thus, we aim to include the haptic component to the most popular wearable used in VR applications: the VR headset. After studying the acuity around the head for vibrating stimuli, and trying different parameters, actuators, and configurations, we developed a haptic guidance technique to be used in a vibrotactile Head-mounted Display (HMD). Our vibrotactile HMD was made to render the position of objects in a 3D space around the subject by varying both stimulus loci and vibration frequency. In this demonstration, the participants will interact with different scenarios where the mission is to select a number of predefined objects. However, instead of displaying occlusive graphical information to point to these objects, vibrotactile cues will provide guidance in the VR setup. Participants will see that our haptic guidance technique can be both easy to use and entertaining.",

The display system is auto-calibrated via 3D reconstruction of each projected pixel on the display using a single inexpensive camera. With the automatic calibration, the multiple-projector system supports a seamless blended imagery on the spherical screen. Furthermore, we incorporate head tracking with the display to present 3D content with motion parallax by rendering perspective-corrected images based on the viewpoint. To show the effectiveness of this design, we implemented a view-dependent application that allows walk-around visualization from all angles for a single head-tracked user. We also implemented a view-independent application that supports a wall-papered rendering for multi-user viewing. Thus, both view-dependent 3D VR content and spherical 2D content, such as a globe, can be easily experienced with this display.",

During 2016 new 360-degree cameras and VR headsets entered the consumer market, distribution platforms are being established and new production studios are emerging. VR is evermore becoming a hot topic in research and industry and many new and exciting interactive VR content and experiences are emerging. The biggest gap we see in these experiences are social and shared aspects of VR. In this demo we present our ongoing efforts towards social and shared VR by developing a modular web based VR framework, that extends current video conferencing capabilities with new functionalities of Virtual and Mixed Reality. It allows us to connect two people together for mediated audio-visual interaction, while being able to engage in interactive content. Our framework allows to run extensive technological and user based trials in order to evaluate VR experiences and to build immersive multi-user interaction spaces. Our first results indicate that a high level of engagement and interaction between users is possible in our 360-degree VR set-up utilizing current web technologies.",

Our approach allows for dynamic repositioning of devices during runtime without the need for external infrastructure such as separate cameras or fiducials.

            "Abstract": "Visualization is a critical component of neuroimaging, and how to best view data that is naturally three dimensional is a long standing question in neuroscience. Many approaches, programs, and techniques have been developed specifically for neuroimaging. However, exploration of 3D information through a 2D screen is inherently limited. Many neuroscientific researchers hope that with the recent commercialization and popularization of VR, it can offer the next-step in data visualization and exploration.  Neuro Imaging in Virtual Reality (NIVR), is a visualization suite that employs various immersive visualizations to represent neuroimaging information in VR. Some established techniques, such as raymarching volume visualization, are paired with newer techniques, such as near-field rendering, to provide a broad basis of how we can leverage VR to improve visualization and navigation of neuroimaging data. Several of the neuroscientific visualization approaches presented are, to our knowledge, the first of their kind.  NIVR offers not only an exploration of neuroscientific data visualization, but also a tool to expose and educate the public regarding recent advancements in the field of neuroimaging. By providing an engaging experience to explore new techniques and discoveries in neuroimaging, we hope to spark scientific interest through a broad audience.  Furthermore, neuroimaging offers deep and expansive datasets; a single scan can involve several gigabytes of information. Visualization and exploration of this type of information can be challenging, and real-time exploration of this information in VR even more so. NIVR explores pathways which make this possible, and offers preliminary stereo visualizations of these types of massive data.",

One of our workflow processes involves algorithmic segmentation of MRI scans into labeled anatomical regions (using FreeSurfer, currently the best software for this purpose). This algorithm is imprecise, and users must tediously correct errors manually by using a mouse and keyboard to edit individual MRI slices at a time. We demonstrate preliminary work to improve efficiency of this task by translating it into 3 dimensions and utilizing virtual reality user interfaces to edit multiple slices of data simultaneously.",

            "Abstract": "Drawing annotations with 3D hand gestures in augmented reality is useful for creating visual and spatial references in the real world, especially when these gestures can be issued from a distance. Different techniques exist for highlighting physical objects with hand-drawn annotations from a distance, assuming an approximate 3D scene model (e.g., as provided by the Microsoft HoloLens). However, little is known about user preference and performance of such methods for annotating real-world 3D environments. To explore and evaluate different 3D hand-gesture-based annotation drawing methods, we have developed an annotation drawing application using the HoloLens augmented reality development platform. The application can be used for highlighting objects at a distance and multi-user collaboration by annotating in the real world.",

It shows an asymmetric collaborative interface in which a remote teacher stands in front of a large display and depth camera (Kinect) while students are immersed with HMDs. The teacher’s front-facing mesh is streamed into the environment to assist students and deliver instruction. Our project uses commodity virtual reality hardware and high-performance networks to allow students who are unable to visit a real facility with an alternative that provides similar educational benefits. Virtual facilities can further be augmented with educational content through interactables or small games. We discuss motivation, features, interface challenges, and ongoing testing.",

            "Abstract": "Virtual objects are essential for building environments in virtual reality (VR) applications. However, creating photorealistic 3D models is not easy, and handcrafting the detailed 3D model from a real object can be time and labor intensive. An alternative way is to build a structured camera array such as a light-stage to reconstruct the model from a real object. However, these technologies are very expensive and not practical for most users. In this work, we demonstrate a complete end-to-end pipeline for the capture, processing, and rendering of view-dependent 3D models in virtual reality from a single consumer-grade RGB-D camera. The geometry model and the camera trajectories are automatically reconstructed from a RGB-D image sequence captured offline. Based on the HMD position, selected images are used for real-time model rendering. The result of this pipeline is a 3D mesh with view-dependent textures suitable for real-time rendering in virtual reality. Specular reflections and light-burst effects are especially noticeable when users view the objects from different perspectives in a head-tracked environment.",

Step into the center of modified chambers and witness the laws of nature be broken in this five-experiment series. VR has all but torn down the barriers between the imagination of the creator and the experience of the viewer. A concept like The Pull simply does not translate into traditional 2D. We can suggest concepts through TVs and monitors, but we can’t truly experience them — and breaking the very laws of nature is something that can only be experienced. While flat media limits us to hinting and coaxing at an experience, by creating in VR, I can more faithfully share my vision with you, the viewer. For a few minutes – for five chambers – I can truly invite you into my world.",

It is certainly critical and compelling to preserve ecosystem for endangered animals. With the awareness of this, we endeavoured to establish a multidisciplinary VR project that implemented data from indigenous villagers (jaguar experts group A), the conventional knowledge of the field of jaguar ecosystem (from jaguar experts group B), and mathematical and statistical models. Our fascination lies in these questions: can we effectively bring together VR and analytical capabilities? Can VR be used to make this world a better place for living beings?

            "Abstract": "Singapore: Inside Out 2015 is an international creative showcase featuring a collection of multi­sensorial experiences designed by the country’s creative talents. After making its successful debut in Beijing, the travelling showcase stops at Brick Lane Yard here in London from 24­28 June for its stint in the capital, before heading to New York in September and a homecoming finale in Singapore in November 2015 (Singapore Inside Out 2015). An energetic, cross­disciplinary showcase of contemporary creative disciplines featuring ­ architecture, food, fashion, film, music, literature, design and the visual arts, this celebration of creativity and collaboration that spans three continents will inspire you to revisit existing preconceptions and discover new perspectives of Singapore and its creative landscape. Having captured seven 360 spherical videos at this event in London itself, I set out to develop all these 360 spherical videos together in one 360 Virtual Reality (VR) Android mobile app, complete with visual interactions via line of sight for directions, graphics, audio and perhaps even ­ transitions. This is to also show a way of providing diegetic means of how these (gaze) interactions will work between and within each 360 videos. The development process would be as follow: 1. Using Unity3D with the Google Cardboard SDK and CSharp scripting 2. Mapping 360 videos inside Unity3D 3. Importing them into Unity3D and using scripting components from within Unity3D to add gaze interactions to navigate between the different 360 videos and other forms of interactions. Launched as an Android apk to your mobile phone, the final “Singapore Inside Out 2015 (London)” interactive VR (Virtual Reality) mobile app enables a viewer to be transported to Brick Lane Yard where the original traveling showcase was last held. Using your line of sight, one can look all around each 360 video to relive the experience of being there, as well as find designated buttons for gaze interaction to be activated. In total, there are about over a dozen interactive features to gaze at. From choosing between VR and Cardboard mode, transition between different 360 videos, displaying credits and graphics to the simple back function, just looking at a certain point inside the 360 video to activate these functions alone ­ took almost more than half of the total development time period. Part of it was the consideration for the duration, the number of seconds ­ we had to set for the gaze to take effect. As each 360 video cannot be previewed from inside the spherical object, aligning these buttons in the right positions while working in Unity has proved to be tedious and painstaking. In addition, the scripted components did not work all the time during all of the testings, and also differed when used between the PC and the Mac. But the most difficult challenge had to be actually scripting in CSharp. In spite of all these challenges ­ both creatively and technically ­ the app was finally completed, and now for all to experience and relive the festival experience in VR!",

            "Abstract": "We developed “Finger Glove for Augmented Reality” (FinGAR), which combines electrical and mechanical stimulation to selectively stimulate skin sensory mechanoreceptors and provide tactile feedback of virtual objects. A DC motor provides high-frequency vibration and shear deformation to the whole finger, and an array of electrodes provide pressure and low-frequency vibration with high spatial resolution. FinGAR devices are attached to the thumb, index finger and middle finger. It is lightweight, simple in mechanism, easy to wear, and does not disturb the natural movements of the hand. All of these attributes are necessary for a general-purpose virtual reality system. User study was conducted to evaluate its ability to reproduce sensations of four tactile dimensions: macro roughness, friction, fine roughness and hardness. Result indicated that skin deformation and cathodic stimulation affect macro roughness and hardness, whereas high-frequency vibration and anodic stimulation affect friction and fine roughness.",

In our study, participants observed a virtual environment where a virtual human (VH) walked toward the participants and paced back and forth within their social space. We compared three conditions as follows: participants in the Sound condition heard the footsteps of the VH; participants in the Vibration condition experienced the vibration of the footsteps along with the sounds; while participants in the Mute condition were not exposed to sound nor vibrotactile feedback. We found that the participants in the Vibration condition felt a higher social presence with the VH compared to those who did not feel the vibration. The participants in the Vibration condition also exhibited greater avoidance behavior while facing the VH and when the VH invaded their personal space.",

            "Abstract": "Due to the perceptual characteristics of the head, vibrotactile Head-mounted Displays are built with low actuator density. Therefore, vibrotactile guidance is mostly assessed by pointing towards objects in the azimuthal plane. When it comes to multisensory interaction in 3D environments, it is also important to convey information about objects in the elevation plane. In this paper, we design and assess a haptic guidance technique for 3D environments. First, we explore the modulation of vibration frequency to indicate the position of objects in the elevation plane. Then, we assessed a vibrotactile HMD made to render the position of objects in a 3D space around the subject by varying both stimulus loci and vibration frequency. Results have shown that frequencies modulated with a quadratic growth function allowed a more accurate, precise, and faster target localization in an active head pointing task. The technique presented high usability and a strong learning effect for a haptic search across different scenarios in an immersive VR setup.",

            "Abstract": "Advances in consumer virtual reality (VR) technology have made using natural locomotion for navigation in VR a possibility. While walking in VR can enhance immersion and reduce motion sickness, it introduces a few challenges. Walking is only possible within virtual environments (VEs) that fit inside the boundaries of the tracked physical space, which for most users is quite small and carries a high potential for collisions with physical objects around the tracked area. In my thesis, I explore visual and physiological steering techniques that complement the traditional redirected walking technique of scene rotation to alter a user&#039;s walking trajectory in the physical space. In this paper, I present the physiological technique.",

The ability to use a haptic interface as a tool for implicit communication can supplement communication and support near and remote collaborative tasks in virtual and physical environments.

In this proposal, we discuss the thesis of the haptic proactive communication and our method to assess and implement it. Our goal is to understand the phenomena related to the proactive articulation of haptic signals and its use for communication and for the design of optimized tactile vocabularies.",

The coordinates of the sight, as well as other data regarding the eyes, are used as input values for the applications. While this trend is becoming more and more popular in the interaction design of immersive systems, most visors do not come with an embedded eye-tracker, especially those that are low cost and maybe based on mobile phones. We suggest implementing an innovative gaze estimation system into virtual environments as a source of information regarding users intentions. We propose a solution based on a combination of the features of the images and the movement of the head as an input of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network capable of inferring the 2D gaze coordinates in the imaging plane.",

            "Abstract": "Most people experience some imbalance in a fully immersive Virtual Environment (VE) (i.e., wearing a Head Mounted Display (HMD) that blocks the users view of the real world). However, this imbalance is significantly worse in People with Balance Impairments (PwBIs) and minimal research has been done to improve this. In addition to imbalance problem, lack of proper visual cues can lead to different accessibility problems for PwBIs (e.g., small reach from the fear of imbalance, decreased gait performance, etc.) We plan to explore the effects of different visual cues on peoples’ balance, reach, gait, etc. Based on our primary study, we propose to incorporate additional visual cues in VEs that proved to significantly improve balance of PwBIs while they are standing and playing in a VE. We plan to further investigate if additional visual cues have similar effects in augmented reality. We are also developing studies to research reach and gait in VR as our future work.",

We extend MPEG-DASH SRD to the 3D space of 360 VR videos, and showcase a dynamic view-aware adaptation technique to tackle the high bandwidth demands of streaming 360 VR videos to wireless VR headsets. As a part of our contributions, we spatially partition the underlying 3D mesh into multiple 3D sub-meshes, and construct an efficient 3D geometry mesh called &quot;hexaface sphere&quot; to optimally represent tiled 360 VR videos in the 3D space. We then spatially divide the 360 videos into multiple tiles while encoding and packaging, use MPEG-DASH SRD to describe the spatial relationship of tiles in the 3D space, and prioritize the tiles in the Field of View (FoV) for view-aware adaptation. The initial evaluations that we conducted show that we can save up to 72% of the required bandwidth on 360 VR video streaming with minor negative quality impacts compared to the baseline scenario when no adaptations is applied.",

            "Abstract": "VR and AR hold enormous promises as paradigm-shifting ubiquitous technologies. The investment in these technologies by leading IT companies, as well as the buy-in and general excitement from outside investors, technologists, and content producers has never been more palpable. There are good reasons to be excited about the field. The real question will be if the technologies can add sufficient value to people’s lives to establish themselves as more than just niche products. My path in this presentation will lead from a personal estimation of what matters for adoption of new technologies to important innovations we have witnessed on the road to anywhere/anytime use of immersive technologies. In recent years, one track of research in my lab has been concerned with the simulation of possible future capabilities in AR. With the goal to conduct controlled user studies evaluating technologies that are just not possible yet (such as a truly wide-field-of-view augmented reality display), we turn to high-end VR to simulate, predict, and assess these possible futures. In the far future, when technological hurdles, such as real-time reconstruction of photorealistic environment models, are removed, VR and AR naturally converge. Until then, we have a very interesting playing field full of technological constraints to have fun with.",

            "Abstract": "We report on the design and results of an experiment investigating factors influencing Slater’s Plausibility Illusion (Psi) in virtual environments (VEs). Slater proposed Psi and Place Illusion (PI) as orthogonal components of virtual experience which contribute to realistic response in a VE. PI corresponds to the traditional conception of presence as “being there,” so there exists a substantial body of previous research relating to PI, but very little relating to Psi. We developed this experiment to investigate the components of plausibility illusion using subjective matching techniques similar to those used in color science. Twenty-one participants each experienced a scenario with the highest level of coherence (the extent to which a scenario matches user expectations and is internally consistent), then in eight different trials chose transitions from lower-coherence to higher-coherence scenarios with the goal of matching the level of Psi they felt in the highest-coherence scenario. At each transition, participants could change one of the following coherence characteristics: the behavior of the other virtual humans in the environment, the behavior of their own body, the physical behavior of objects, or the appearance of the environment. Participants tended to choose improvements to the virtual body before any other improvements. This indicates that having an accurate and well-behaved representation of oneself in the virtual environment is the most important contributing factor to Psi. This study is the first to our knowledge to focus specifically on coherence factors in virtual environments.",

            "Abstract": "We describe an experiment that explores the contribution of auditory and other features to the illusion of plausibility in a virtual environment that depicts the performance of a string quartet. ‘Plausibility’ refers to the component of presence that is the illusion that the perceived events in the virtual environment are really happening. The features studied were: Gaze (the musicians ignored the participant, the musicians sometimes looked towards and followed the participant’s movements), Sound Spatialization (Mono, Stereo, Spatial), Auralization (no sound reflections, reflections corresponding to a room larger than the one perceived, reflections that exactly matched the virtual room), and Environment (no sound from outside of the room, birdsong and wind corresponding to the outside scene). We adopted the methodology based on color matching theory, where 20 participants were first able to assess their feeling of plausibility in the environment with each of the four features at their highest setting. Then five times participants started from a low setting on all features and were able to make transitions from one system configuration to another until they matched their original feeling of plausibility. From these transitions a Markov transition matrix was constructed, and also probabilities of a match conditional on feature configuration. The results show that Environment and Gaze were individually the most important factors influencing the level of plausibility. The highest probability transitions were to improve Environment and Gaze, and then Auralization and Spatialization. We present this work as both a contribution to the methodology of assessing presence without questionnaires, and showing how various aspects of a musical performance can influence plausibility.",

            "Abstract": "The emotional response a person has to a living space is predominantly affected by light, color and texture as space-making elements. In order to verify whether this phenomenon could be replicated in a simulated environment, we conducted a user study in a six-sided projected immersive display that utilized equivalent design attributes of brightness, color and texture in order to assess to which extent the emotional response in a simulated environment is affected by the same parameters affecting real environments. Since emotional response depends upon the context, we evaluated the emotional responses of two groups of users: inactive (passive) and active (performing a typical daily activity). The results from the perceptual study generated data from which design principles for a virtual living space are articulated. Such a space, as an alternative to expensive built dwellings, could potentially support new, minimalist lifestyles of occupants, defined as the neo-nomads, aligned with their work experience in the digital domain through the generation of emotional experiences of spaces. Data from the experiments confirmed the hypothesis that perceivable emotional aspects of real-world spaces could be successfully generated through simulation of design attributes in the virtual space. The subjective response to the virtual space was consistent with corresponding responses from real-world color and brightness emotional perception. Our data could serve the virtual reality (VR) community in its attempt to conceive of further applications of virtual spaces for well-defined activities.",

However, little is known about the impact such immersive experiences will have on children (aged 0-18 years). This paper outlines perspectives on child development to present conceptual and practical frameworks for conducting ethical research with children using immersive HMD technologies. The paper addresses not only procedural ethics (gaining institutional approval) but also ethics-in-practice (on-going ethical decision-making).",

            "Abstract": "Traditionally in virtual reality systems, head tracking is used in head-mounted displays (HMDs) to allow users to control viewing using 360-degree head and body rotations. Our research explores interaction considerations that enable semi-natural methods of view control that will work for seated use of virtual reality with HMDs when physically turning all the way around is not ideal, such as when sitting on a couch or at a desk. We investigate the use of amplified head rotations so physically turning in a comfortable range can allow viewing of a 360-degree virtual range. Additionally, to avoid situations where the user&#039;s neck is turned in an uncomfortable position for an extended period, we also use redirection during virtual movement to gradually realign the user&#039;s head position back to the neutral, straight-ahead position. We ran a controlled experiment to evaluate guided head rotation and amplified head rotation without realignment during movement, and we compared both to traditional one-to-one head-tracked viewing as a baseline for reference. After a navigation task, overall errors on spatial orientation tasks were relatively low with all techniques, but orientation effects, sickness, and preferences varied depending on participants&#039; 3D gaming habits. Using the guided rotation technique, participants who played 3D games performed better, reported higher preference scores, and demonstrated significantly lower sickness results compared to non-gamers.",

            "Abstract": "For many virtual reality applications, a pre-calculated fly-through path is the emph{de facto} standard navigation method. Such a path is convenient for users and ensures coverage of critical areas throughout the scene. Traditional applications use constant camera speed, allow for fully user-controlled manual speed adjustment, or use automatic speed adjustment based on heuristics from the scene. We introduce two novel methods for constrained path navigation and exploration in virtual environments which rely on the natural orientation of the user&#039;s head during scene exploration. Utilizing head tracking to obtain the user&#039;s area of focus, we perform automatic camera speed adjustment to allow for natural off-axis scene examination. We expand this to include automatic camera navigation along the pre-computed path, abrogating the need for any navigational inputs from the user. Our techniques are applicable for any scene with a pre-computed navigation path, including medical applications such as virtual colonoscopy, coronary fly-through, or virtual angioscopy, and graph navigation. We compare the traditional methods (constant speed and manual speed adjustment) and our two methods (automatic speed adjustment and automatic speed/direction control) to determine the effect of speed adjustment on system usability, mental load, performance, and user accuracy. Through this evaluation we observe the effect of automatic speed adjustment compared to traditional methods. We observed no negative impact from automatic navigation, and the users performed as well as with the manual navigation.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel immersive system called MR360 that provides interactive mixed reality (MR) experiences using a conventional low dynamic range (LDR) 360° panoramic video (360-video) shown in head mounted displays (HMDs). MR360 seamlessly composites 3D virtual objects into a live 360-video using the input panoramic video as the lighting source to illuminate the virtual objects. Image based lighting (IBL) is perceptually optimized to provide fast and believable results using the LDR 360-video as the lighting source. Regions of most salient lights in the input panoramic video are detected to optimize the number of lights used to cast perceptible shadows. Then, the areas of the detected lights adjust the penumbra of the shadow to provide realistic soft shadows. Finally, our real-time differential rendering synthesizes illumination of the virtual 3D objects into the 360-video. MR360 provides the illusion of interacting with objects in a video, which are actually 3D virtual objects seamlessly composited into the background of the 360-video. MR360 was implemented in a commercial game engine and tested using various 360-videos. Since our MR360 pipeline does not require any pre-computation, it can synthesize an interactive MR scene using a live 360-video stream while providing realistic high performance rendering suitable for HMDs.",

While monoscopic 360-videos are one of the most common content for VR headsets, they lack 3D information and thus cannot be viewed with full 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF). We present an approach that addresses this limitation via a novel warping algorithm that can synthesize new views both with rotational and translational motion of the viewpoint. This enables to playback an input monoscopic 360-video in a VR headset where the new viewpoints are determined by the 6-DOF motion of the headset. Our solution tailors standard structure-from-motion and dense reconstruction algorithms to work accurately for 360-videos and is optimized for GPUs to achieve VR frame rates (&#62; 120 fps). We demonstrate the effectiveness our approach on a variety of videos with interesting content.",

            "Abstract": "The proliferation of head-mounted displays (HMD) in the market means that cinematic virtual reality (CVR) is an increasingly popular format. We explore several metrics that may indicate advantages and disadvantages of CVR compared to traditional viewing formats such as TV. We explored the consumption of panoramic videos in three different display systems: a HMD, a SurroundVideo+ (SV+), and a standard 16:9 TV. The SV+ display features a TV with projected peripheral content. A between-groups experiment of 63 participants was conducted, in which participants watched panoramic videos in one of these three display conditions. Aspects examined in the experiment were spatial awareness, narrative engagement, enjoyment, memory, fear, attention, and a viewer’s concern about missing something. Our results indicated that the HMD offered a significant benefit in terms of enjoyment and spatial awareness, and our SV+ display offered a significant improvement in enjoyment over traditional TV. We were unable to confirm the work of a previous study that showed incidental memory may be lower in a HMD over a TV. Drawing attention and a viewer’s concern about missing something were also not significantly different between display conditions. It is clear that passive media viewing consists of a complex interplay of factors, such as the media itself, the characteristics of the display, as well as human aspects including perception and attention. While passive media viewing presents many challenges for evaluation, identifying a number of broadly applicable metrics will aid our understanding of these experiences, and allow the creation of better, more engaging CVR content and displays.",

Indeed, food waste is a major issue for the retail sector and a recent trend is to reduce it by selling non-standard goods. An important question for retailers relates to the FaVs&#039; ``level of abnormality&#039;&#039; that consumers would agree to buy. However, this question cannot be tackled using ``classical&#039;&#039; marketing techniques that perform user studies within real shops since fresh produce such as FaVs tend to rot rapidly preventing studies to be repeatable or to be run for a long time. In order to overcome those limitations, we created a virtual grocery store with a fresh FaVs section where 142 participants were immersed using an Oculus Rift DK2 HMD. Participants were presented either ``normal&#039;&#039;, ``slightly misshaped&#039;&#039;, ``misshaped&#039;&#039; or ``severely misshaped&#039;&#039; FaVs. Results show that participants tend to purchase a similar number of FaVs whatever their deformity.

We designed four virtual reality experiments with different tasks for participants to complete: strike a ball to hit a target, trigger a ball to hit a target, predict the landing location of a projectile, and estimate the flight duration of a projectile. The first two experiments compared human behavior in the virtual environment with real-world performance reported in the literature. The last two experiments aimed to test the human ability to adapt to novel gravity fields by measuring their performance in trajectory prediction and time estimation tasks. The experiment results show that: 1) based on brief observation of a projectile’s initial trajectory, humans are accurate at predicting the landing location even under novel gravity fields, and 2) humans’ time estimation in a familiar earth environment fluctuates around the ground truth flight duration, although the time estimation in unknown gravity fields indicates a bias toward earth’s gravity.",

            "Abstract": "The reduced gravity experienced in lunar or Martian surfaces can be simulated on the earth using a cable-driven system, where the cable lifts a person to reduce his or her weight. This paper presents a novel cable-driven system designed for the purpose. It is integrated with a head-mounted display and a motion capture system. Focusing on jump motion within the system, this paper proposes to scale the jump and reports the experiments made for quantifying the extent to which a jump can be scaled without the discrepancy between physical and virtual jumps being noticed by the user. With the tolerable range of scaling computed from these experiments, an application named retargeted jump is developed, where a user can jump up onto virtual objects while physically jumping in the real-world flat floor. The core techniques presented in this paper can be extended to develop extreme-sport simulators such as parasailing and skydiving.",

            "Abstract": "Recent popularity of consumer-grade virtual reality devices, such as the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, has enabled household users to experience highly immersive virtual environments. We take advantage of the commercial availability of these devices to provide an immersive and novel virtual reality training approach, designed to teach individuals how to survive earthquakes, in common indoor environments. Our approach makes use of virtual environments realistically populated with furniture objects for training. During a training, a virtual earthquake is simulated. The user navigates in, and manipulates with, the virtual environments to avoid getting hurt, while learning the observation and self-protection skills to survive an earthquake. We demonstrated our approach for common scene types such as offices, living rooms and dining rooms. To test the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted an evaluation by asking users to train in several rooms of a given scene type and then test in a new room of the same type. Evaluation results show that our virtual reality training approach is effective, with the participants who are trained by our approach performing better, on average, than those trained by alternative approaches in terms of the capabilities to avoid physical damage and to detect potentially dangerous objects.",

            "Abstract": "This work presents an evaluation study in which the effects of a penalty-based and a constraint-based haptic rendering algorithm on the user performance and perception are analyzed. A total of N = 24 participants performed in a within-design study three variations of peg-in-hole tasks in a virtual environment after trials in an identically replicated real scenario as a reference. In addition to the two mentioned haptic rendering paradigms, two haptic devices were used, the HUG and a Sigma.7, and the force stiffness was also varied with maximum and half values possible for each device. Both objective (time and trajectory, collision performance, and muscular effort) and subjective ratings (contact perception, ergonomy, and workload) were recorded and statistically analyzed. The results show that the constraint-based haptic rendering algorithm with a lower stiffness than the maximum possible yields the most realistic contact perception, while keeping the visual inter-penetration between the objects roughly at around 15% of that caused by penalty-based algorithm (i.e., non perceptible in many cases). This result is even more evident with the HUG, the haptic device with the highest force display capabilities, although user ratings point to the Sigma.7 as the device with highest usability and lowest workload indicators. Altogether, the paper provides qualitative and quantitative guidelines for mapping properties of haptic algorithms and devices to user performance and perception.",

It is conceived as a research tool for studying topics related to haptics in VR and based on off-the-shelf components. A robotic arm moves physical props, dynamically matching pose and location of an object in the virtual world. When the user reaches for the virtual object, his or her hands also encounter it in the real physical space. The interaction is not limited to specific body parts and does not rely on an external structure like an exoskeleton. In combination with a locomotion platform for close-to-natural walking, this allows unrestricted haptic interaction in a natural way in virtual environments of unlimited size. We describe the concept, the hardware and software architecture in detail. We establish safety design guidelines for human-robot interaction in VR. Our technical evaluation shows good response times and accuracy. We report on a user study conducted with 34 participants indicating promising results, and discuss the potential of our system.",

In this ar- ticle we present a novel and alternative approach for producing self-motion sensations in driving simulations by relying on haptic- feedback. The method consists in applying a force-feedback pro- portional to the acceleration of the virtual vehicle directly in the hands of the driver, by means of a haptic device attached to the manipulated controller (or a steering wheel). We designed a proof- of-concept based on a standard gamepad physically attached at the extremity of a standard 3DOF haptic display. Haptic effects were designed to match notably the acceleration/braking (longitudinal forces) and left/right turns (lateral forces) of the virtual vehicle. A preliminary study conducted with 23 participants, engaged in gamepad-based active VR navigations in a straight line, showed that haptic motion effects globally improved the involvement and realism of motion sensation for participants with prior experience with haptic devices. Taken together, our results suggest that our approach could be further tested and used in driving simulators in entertainment and/or professional contexts.",

This concept combines actuators known from active haptics and physical proxies known from passive haptics to construct proxies that automatically adapt their passive haptic feedback. We describe the concept behind our ungrounded weight-shifting DPHF proxy Shifty and the implementation of our prototype. We then investigate how Shifty can, by automatically changing its internal weight distribution, enhance the user’s perception of virtual objects interacted with in two experiments. In a first experiment, we show that Shifty can enhance the perception of virtual objects changing in shape, especially in length and thickness. Here, Shifty was shown to increase the user’s fun and perceived realism significantly, compared to an equivalent passive haptic proxy. In a second experiment, Shifty is used to pick up virtual objects of different virtual weights. The results show that Shifty enhances the perception of weight and thus the perceived realism by adapting its kinesthetic feedback to the picked-up virtual object. In the same experiment, we additionally show that specific combinations of haptic, visual and auditory feedback during the pick-up interaction help to compensate for visual-haptic mismatch perceived during the shifting process.",

For locomotion and navigation, the introduction of multiple users moving both virtually and physically creates additional challenges related to potential user-on-user collisions. In this work, we focus on defining the extent of these challenges, in order to apply redirected walking to two users immersed in virtual reality experiences within a shared physical tracked space. Using a computer simulation framework, we explore the costs and benefits of splitting available physical space between users versus attempting to algorithmically prevent user-to-user collisions. We also explore fundamental components of collision prevention such as steering the users away from each other, forced stopping, and user re-orientation. Each component was analyzed for the number of potential disruptions to the flow of the virtual experience. We also develop a novel collision prevention algorithm that reduces overall interruptions by 17.6% and collision prevention events by 58.3%. Our results show that sharing space using our collision prevention method is superior to subdividing the tracked space.",

            "Abstract": "Redirected walking (RDW) promises to allow near-natural walking in an infinitely large virtual environment (VE) by subtle manipulations of the virtual camera. Previous experiments analyzed the human sensitivity to RDW manipulations by focusing on the worst-case scenario, in which users walk perfectly straight ahead in the VE, whereas they are redirected on a circular path in the real world. The results showed that a physical radius of at least 22 meters is required for undetectable RDW. However, users do not always walk exactly straight in a VE. So far, it has not been investigated how much a physical path can be bent in situations in which users walk a virtual curved path instead of a straight one. Such curved walking paths can be often observed, for example, when users walk on virtual trails, through bent corridors, or when circling around obstacles. In such situations the question is not, whether or not the physical path can be bent, but how much the bending of the physical path may vary from the bending of the virtual path. In this article, we analyze this question and present redirection by means of bending gains that describe the discrepancy between the bending of curved paths in the real and virtual environment. Furthermore, we report the psychophysical experiments in which we analyzed the human sensitivity to these gains. The results reveal encouragingly wider detection thresholds than for straightforward walking. Based on our findings, we discuss the potential of curved walking and present a first approach to leverage bent paths in a way that can provide undetectable RDW manipulations even in room-scale VR.",

            "Abstract": "In immersive Virtual Reality systems, users tend to move in a Virtual Environment as they would in an analogous physical environment. In this work, we investigated how user behaviour is affected when the Virtual Environment differs from the physical space. We created two sets of four environments each, plus a virtual replica of the physical environment as a baseline. The first focused on aesthetic discrepancies, such as a water surface in place of solid ground. The second focused on mixing immaterial objects together with those paired to tangible objects. For example, barring an area with walls or obstacles. We designed a study where participants had to reach three waypoints laid out in such a way to prompt a decision on which path to follow based on the conflict between the mismatching visual stimuli and their awareness of the real layout of the room. We analysed their performances to determine whether their trajectories were altered significantly from the shortest route. Our results indicate that participants altered their trajectories in presence of surfaces representing higher walking difficulty (for example, water instead of grass). However, when the graphical appearance was found to be ambiguous, there was no significant trajectory alteration. The environments mixing immaterial with physical objects had the most impact on trajectories with a mean deviation from the shortest route of 60 cm against the 37 cm of environments with aesthetic alterations. The co-existance of paired and unpaired virtual objects was reported to support the idea that all objects participants saw were backed by physical props. From these results and our observations, we derive guidelines on how to alter user movement behaviour in Virtual Environments.",

            "Abstract": "We propose an acoustic-VR system that converts acoustic signals of human language (Chinese) to realistic 3D tongue animation sequences in real time. It is known that directly capturing the 3D geometry of the tongue at a frame rate that matches the tongue&#039;s swift movement during the language production is challenging. This difficulty is handled by utilizing the electromagnetic articulography (EMA) sensor as the intermediate medium linking the acoustic data to the simulated virtual reality. We leverage Deep Neural Networks to train a model that maps the input acoustic signals to the positional information of pre-defined EMA sensors based on 1,108 utterances. Afterwards, we develop a novel reduced physics-based dynamics model for simulating the tongue&#039;s motion. Unlike the existing methods, our deformable model is nonlinear, volume-preserving, and accommodates collision between the tongue and the oral cavity (mostly with the jaw). The tongue&#039;s deformation could be highly localized which imposes extra difficulties for existing spectral model reduction methods. Alternatively, we adopt a spatial reduction method that allows an expressive subspace representation of the tongue&#039;s deformation. We systematically evaluate the simulated tongue shapes with real-world shapes acquired by MRI/CT. Our experiment demonstrates that the proposed system is able to deliver a realistic visual tongue animation corresponding to a user&#039;s speech signal.",

            "Abstract": "An important component of the modeling of sound propagation for virtual reality (VR) is the spatialization of the room impulse response (RIR) for directional listeners. This involves convolution of the listener&#039;s head-related transfer function (HRTF) with the RIR to generate a spatial room impulse response (SRIR) which can be used to auralize the sound entering the listener&#039;s ear canals. Previous approaches tend to evaluate the HRTF for each sound propagation path, though this is too slow for interactive VR latency requirements. We present a new technique for computation of the SRIR that performs the convolution with the HRTF in the spherical harmonic (SH) domain for RIR partitions of a fixed length. The main contribution is a novel perceptually-driven metric that adaptively determines the lowest SH order required for each partition to result in no perceptible error in the SRIR. By using lower SH order for some partitions, our technique saves a significant amount of computation and is almost an order of magnitude faster than the previous approach. We compared the subjective impact of this new method to the previous one and observe a strong scene-dependent preference for our technique. As a result, our method is the first that can compute high-quality spatial sound for the entire impulse response fast enough to meet the audio latency requirements of interactive virtual reality applications.",

A blendshape rig with a skeleton is used as a template for customization. Identity blendshapes are used to customize the body and face shape at the fitting stage, while animation blendshapes allow the face to be animated. The subject assumes a T-pose and a single snapshot is captured using a stereo RGB plus depth sensor rig. Our system automatically aligns a photo texture and fits the 3D shape of the face. The body shape is stylized according to body dimensions estimated from segmented depth. The face identity blendweights are optimised according to image-based facial landmarks, while a custom texture map for the face is generated by warping the input images to a reference texture according to the facial landmarks. The total capture and processing time is under 10~seconds and the output is a light-weight, game-engine-ready avatar which is recognizable as the subject. We demonstrate our system in a VR environment in which each user sees the other users&#039; animated avatars through a VR headset with real-time audio-based facial animation and live body motion tracking, affording an enhanced level of presence and social engagement compared to generic avatars.",

It is unknown, however, how visual feedback from a self-avatar influences a user&#039;s online actions and subsequent calibration of actions within an immersive VE. The current paper uses a prism throwing adaptation paradigm to test the role of a self-avatar arm or full body on action calibration in a VE. Participants&#039; throwing accuracy to a target on the ground was measured first in a normal viewing environment, then with the visual field rotated clockwise about their vertical axis by 17 degrees (prism simulation), and then again in the normal viewing environment with the prism distortion removed. Participants experienced either no-avatar, a first-person avatar arm and hand, or a first-person full body avatar during the entire experimental session, in a between-subjects manipulation. Results showed similar throwing error and adaptation during the prism exposure for all conditions, but a reduced aftereffect (displacement with respect to the target in the opposite direction of the prism-exposure) when the avatar arm or full body was present. The results are discussed in the context of how an avatar can provide a visual frame of reference to aid in action calibration.",

One way to influence communication skills is to leverage MRHs as models of communication behavior. We created a mixed reality medical team training exercise designed to impact communication behaviors that are critical for patient safety. We recruited anesthesia residents to go through an operating room training exercise with MRHs to assess and influence residents&#039; closed loop communication behaviors during medication administration. We manipulated the behavior of the MRHs to determine if the MRHs could influence the residents&#039; closed loop communication behavior. Our results showed that residents&#039; closed loop communications behaviors were influenced by MRHs. Additionally, we found there was a statistically significant difference between groups based on which MRH behavior residents observed. Because the MRHs significantly impacted how residents communicated in simulation, this work expands the boundaries for how VR can be used and demonstrates that MRHs could be used as tools to address complex communication dynamics in a team setting",

            "Abstract": "Commodity depth sensors, such as the Microsoft Kinect®, have been widely used for the capture and reconstruction of the 3D structure of a room-sized dynamic scene. Camera placement and coverage during capture significantly impact the quality of the resulting reconstruction. In particular, dynamic occlusions and sensor interference have been shown to result in poor resolution and holes in the reconstruction results. This paper presents a novel algorithmic framework and an off-line optimization of depth sensor placements for a given 3D dynamic scene, simulated using virtual 3D models. We derive a fitness metric for a particular configuration of sensors by combining factors such as visibility and resolution of the entire dynamic scene along with probabilities of interference between sensors. We employ this fitness metric both in a greedy algorithm that determines the number of depth sensors needed to cover the scene, and in a simulated annealing algorithm that optimizes the placements of those sensors. We compare our algorithm’s optimized placements with manual sensor placements for a real dynamic scene. We present quantitative assessments using our fitness metric, as well as qualitative assessments to demonstrate that our algorithm not only enhances the resolution and total coverage of the reconstruction but also fills in voids by avoiding occlusions and sensor interference when compared with the reconstruction of the same scene using a manual sensor placement.",

            "Abstract": "The accurate calibration and registration of a set of color and depth (RGBD) sensors into a shared coordinate system is an essential requirement for 3D surround capturing systems. We present a method to calibrate multiple unsynchronized RGBD-sensors with high accuracy in a matter of minutes by sweeping a tracked checkerboard through the desired capturing space in front of each sensor. Through the sweeping process, a large number of robust correspondences between the depth and the color image as well as the 3D world positions can be automatically established. In order to obtain temporally synchronized correspondences between an RGBD-sensor’s data streams and the tracked target’s positions we apply an off-line optimization process based on error minimization and a coplanarity constraint. The correspondences are entered into a 3D look-up table which is used during runtime to transform depth and color information into the application’s world coordinate system. Our proposed method requires a manual effort of less than one minute per RGBD-sensor and achieves a high calibration accuracy with an average 3D error below 3.5 mm and an average texture reprojection error smaller than 1 pixel.",

            "Abstract": "We propose a facial expression mapping technology between virtual avatars and Head-Mounted Display (HMD) users. HMD allow people to enjoy an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experience. A virtual avatar can be a representative of the user in the virtual environment. However, the synchronization of the the virtual avatar&#039;s expressions with those of the HMD user is limited. The major problem of wearing an HMD is that a large portion of the user&#039;s face is occluded, making facial recognition difficult in an HMD-based virtual environment. To overcome this problem, we propose a facial expression mapping technology using retro-reflective photoelectric sensors. The sensors attached inside the HMD measures the distance between the sensors and the user&#039;s face. The distance values of five basic facial expressions (Neutral, Happy, Angry, Surprised, and Sad) are used for training the neural network to estimate the facial expression of a user. We achieved an overall accuracy of 88% in recognizing the facial expressions. Our system can also reproduce facial expression change in real-time through an existing avatar using regression. Consequently, our system enables estimation and reconstruction of facial expressions that correspond to the user&#039;s emotional changes.",

            "Abstract": "Modularity, modifiability, reusability, and API usability are important software qualities that determine the maintainability of software architectures. Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR, AR, MR) systems, modern computer games, as well as interactive human-robot systems often include various dedicated input-, output-, and processing subsystems. These subsystems collectively maintain a real-time simulation of a coherent application state. The resulting interdependencies between individual state representations, mutual state access, overall synchronization, and flow of control implies a conceptual close coupling whereas software quality asks for a decoupling to develop maintainable solutions. This article presents five semantics-based software techniques that address this contradiction: Semantic grounding, code from semantics, grounded actions, semantic queries, and decoupling by semantics. These techniques are applied to extend the well-established entity-component-system (ECS) pattern to overcome some of this pattern’s deficits with respect to the implied state access. A walk-through of central implementation aspects of a multimodal (speech and gesture) VR-interface is used to highlight the techniques’ benefits. This use-case is chosen as a prototypical example of complex architectures with multiple interacting subsystems found in many VR, AR and MR architectures. Finally, implementation hints are given, lessons learned regarding maintainability pointed-out, and performance implications discussed.",

            "Abstract": "Modern scientific, engineering and medical computational simulations, as well as experimental and observational data sensing/measuring devices, produce enormous amounts of data. While statistical analysis is one tool that provides insight into this data, it is scientific visualization that is tactically important for scientific discovery, product design and data analysis. These benefits are impeded, however, when the scientific visualization algorithms are implemented from scratch | a time consuming and redundant process in immersive application development. This process then can greatly benefit from leveraging the state-of-the-art open-source Visualization Toolkit (VTK) and its community. Over the past two (almost three) decades, integrating VTK with a virtual reality (VR) environment has only been attempted to varying degrees of success. In this paper, we demonstrate two new approaches to simplify this amalgamation of an immersive interface with visualization rendering from VTK. In addition, we cover several enhancements to VTK that provide near real-time updates and efficient interaction. Finally, we demonstrate the combination of VTK with both Vrui and OpenVR immersive environments in example applications.",

Our system consists of two major components: an automatic 2D-to-3D cartoon model creator and an interactive model editor to construct more complicated AR scenes. The model creator can generate textured 3D cartoon models according to 2D drawings automatically and overlay them on the real world, bringing life to flat cartoon drawings. With our interactive model editor, the user can perform several optional operations on 3D models such as copying and animating in AR context through a touchscreen of a handheld device. The user can also author more complicated AR scenes by placing multiple registered drawings simultaneously. The results of our user study have shown that our system is easier to use compared with traditional sketch-based modeling systems and can give more play to children&#039;s innovations compared with AR coloring books.",

            "Abstract": "For neurodegenerative conditions like Parkinson’s disease, early and accurate diagnosis is still a difficult task. Evaluations can be time consuming, patients must often travel to metropolitan areas or different cities to see experts, and misdiagnosis can result in improper treatment. To date, only a handful of assistive or remote methods exist to help physicians evaluate patients with suspected neurological disease in a convenient and consistent way. In this paper, we present a low-cost VR interface designed to support evaluation and diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease and test its use in a clinical setting. Using a commercially available VR display with an infrared camera integrated into the lens, we have constructed a 3D virtual environment designed to emulate common tasks used to evaluate patients, such as fixating on a point, conducting smooth pursuit of an object, or executing saccades. These virtual tasks are designed to elicit eye movements commonly associated with neurodegenerative disease, such as abnormal saccades, square wave jerks, and ocular tremor. Next, we conducted experiments with 9 patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease and 7 healthy controls to test the system’s potential to emulate tasks for clinical diagnosis. We then applied eye tracking algorithms and image enhancement to the eye recordings taken during the experiment and conducted a short follow-up study with two physicians for evaluation. Results showed that our VR interface was able to elicit five common types of movements usable for evaluation, physicians were able to confirm three out of four abnormalities, and visualizations were rated as potentially useful for diagnosis.",

            "Abstract": "Pretend play is a storytelling technique, naturally used from very young ages, which relies on object substitution to represent the characters of the imagined story. We propose a system which assists the storyteller by generating a virtualized story from a recorded dialogue performed with 3D printed figurines. We capture the gestures and facial expressions of the storyteller using Kinect cameras and IMU sensors and transfer them to their virtual counterparts in the story-world. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate our system with an improvised story involving a prince and a witch, which was successfully recorded and transferred into 3D animation.",

A low-power transmitter antenna acts as a reference for three tracker modules. One module, attached to the Head Mount Display (HMD), tracks the position and orientation of user&#039;s head and the other two hand-held modules act as an interface device (like virtual hands) in Virtual Reality. This precise, low power, low latency, non-line-of-sight system provides an easy-to-use human-computer interface. The system achieves a precision of 1 mm in position with 0.1 degree in orientation and an accuracy of 20 cm in position at a distance of 2 m from the antenna. The transmitter and the receiver consume 5 W and 0.4 W of power, respectively, providing 140 updates/sec with 11 ms of latency.",

Our proposed hybrid SAR system utilizes OST-HMD as an extra rendering layer to render a view-dependent property in OST-HMDs according to the viewer&#039;s viewpoint. Combined with view-independent components created by a static projector, the viewer can see richer material contents. Unlike conventional SAR systems, our system theoretically allows unlimited number of viewers seeing enhanced contents in the same space while keeping the existing SAR experiences. Furthermore, the system enhances the total dynamic range, the maximum intensity, and the resolution of perceived materials. With a proof-of-concept system that consists of a projector and an OST-HMD, we qualitatively demonstrate that our system successfully creates hybrid rendering on a hemisphere object from five horizontal viewpoints. Our quantitative evaluation also shows that our system increases the dynamic range by 2.1 times and the maximum intensity by 1.9 times compared to an ordinary SAR system.",

            "Abstract": "We present a method for focal distance estimation of a freely-orienting eye using Purkinje-Sanson (PS) images, which are reflections of light on the inner structures of the eye. Using an infrared camera with a rigidly-fixed LED, our method creates an estimation model based on 3D gaze and the distance between reflections in the PS images that occur on the corneal surface and anterior surface of the eye lens. The distance between these two reflections changes with focus, so we associate that information to the focal distance on a user. Unlike conventional methods that mainly relies on 2D pupil size which is sensitive to scene lighting and the fourth PS image, our method detects the third PS image which is more representative of accommodation. Our feasibility study on a single user with a focal range from 15-45 cm shows that our method achieves mean and median absolute errors of 3.15 and 1.93 cm for a 10-degree viewing angle. The study shows that our method is also tolerant against environment lighting changes.",

We compared a standard non-motion cueing interface, Joystick, with four leaning-based seated motion-cueing interfaces: NaviChair, MuvMan, Head-Directed and Swivel Chair. The aim of this mixed methods study was to investigate the usability and user experience of each interface, in order to better understand relevant factors and guide the design of future ground-based VR locomotion interfaces. We asked participants to give talk-aloud feedback and simultaneously recorded their responses while they were performing a search task in VR. Afterwards, participants completed an online questionnaire. Although the Joystick was rated as more comfortable and precise than the other interfaces, the leaning-based interfaces showed a trend to provide more enjoyment and a greater sense of self-motion. There were also potential issues of using velocity-control for rotations in leaning-based interfaces when using HMDs instead of stationary displays. Developers need to focus on improving the controllability and perceived safety of these seated motion cueing interfaces.",

Three primary domains (pace, base of support and phase) of spatio-temporal and temporo-phasic parameters were used to evaluate gait performance. Our results show similar results in pace and phasic domains when older adults walk in the VE in the isometric mapping condition compared to the corresponding parameters in the real world. We found significant differences in base of support for our user group between walking in the VE and real world. For non-isometric mappings we found an increased divergence of gait parameters in all domains correlating with the up- or down-scaled velocity of visual self-motion feedback.",

            "Abstract": "Uncertainty in measurement of point correspondences negatively affects the accuracy and precision in the calibration of head-mounted displays (HMD). Such errors depend on the sensors and pose estimation for video see-through HMD. For optical see-through systems, it additionally depends on the user&#039;s head motion and hand-eye coordination. Therefore, the distribution of alignment errors for optical see-through calibration are not isotropic, and one can estimate its process specific or user specific distribution based on interaction requirements of a given calibration process and the user&#039;s measurable head motion and hand-eye coordination characteristics. Current calibration methods, however, mostly utilize the DLT method which minimizes Euclidean distances for HMD projection matrix estimation, disregarding the anisotropicity in the alignment errors. We will show how to utilize the error covariance in order to take the anisotropic nature of error distribution into account. The main hypothesis of this study is that using Mahalonobis distance within the nonlinear optimization can improve the accuracy of the HMD calibration. To cover a wide range of possible realistic scenarios, several simulations were performed with variation in the extent of the anisotropicity in the input data along with other parameters. The simulation results indicate that our new method outperforms the standard DLT method both in accuracy and precision, and is more robust against user alignment errors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that anisotropic noise has been accommodated in the optical see-through HMD calibration.",

The end result is that the user sees the virtual content as if it exists inside the clear physical box.

We compared Specimen Box to Grab-and-Twirl, a naturalistic bimanual manipulation technique that closely mimics the mechanics of our proposed technique.

The proposed marker is composed of a random dots pattern, and uses keypoint detection and a scale estimation by Spectral SIFT for dots detection and data decoding. The data is encoded by the scale size of dots, and the same dots in the marker work for both marker detection and data decoding. As a result, the proposed marker size can be compact. We confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed marker through experiments.",

In the first, a pilot ethnographic study, users were interviewed in immersive social virtual reality about their experiences and behaviors in these spaces. Harassment was occasional, and those in female avatars reported more harassment than those in male avatars. In Study Two, a quantitative survey was conducted to validate ethnographic results. A large percentage of users witness harassment in virtual reality. These studies provide mixed methods insight of user demographics and behaviors in the relatively new social VR space.",

However, there is currently a lack of guidelines for achieving interaction fidelity for these systems. In this paper, we present the design of two navigation techniques for a needle insertion trainer. The two techniques were analyzed using a state-of-the-art fidelity framework to determine their level of interaction fidelity. A user study comparing both techniques suggests that the higher fidelity technique is more suited as a navigation technique for the needle insertion virtual trainer.",

            "Abstract": "Recently, several virtual reality (VR) systems using wind have been built to enhance the user’s sense of presence. If wind is used, users need not use additional devices, and some studies have concluded that using wind and presenting a video simultaneously improves this sense of presence. In these studies, however, wind sources were sparsely arranged; with such an arrangement, it is unclear whether an accurate environment was reproduced. A number of variables including gender, age, and the facial hit rate may affect the perception of wind direction. In the proposed study, we have examined the effect of these variables on perception of wind direction by the head.",

This preliminary work examines how individuals, performing a targeted ball throwing task, adapted to addition and removal of a translational scaling of the ball&#039;s forward flight. This was examined under various conditions: flight of the ball shown with no delay, hidden flight of the ball with no delay, and hidden flight with a 2 second delay. Hiding the ball’s flight, as well as the delay, created disruptions in the ability of the participants to perform the task and adapt to new scaling conditions.",

            "Abstract": "Although fulldome video digital theaters evolved from traditional planetariums, they are more akin to virtual reality (VR) theaters that create large-scale, group immersive experiences. In order to help understand how immersion and wide fields-of-view (FOV) impact learning, we studied the use of visualizations on topics that do and do not require spatial understanding in astronomy classes. We find a significant difference between students who viewed visualizations in the dome versus those that saw non-immersive content in their classrooms, with the former showing the greatest retention. Our results suggest that immersive visuals help free up cognitive resources that can be used to build mental models requiring spatial understanding, and the physical display size combined with the wide FOV may result in greater attention. Although fulldome is a complementary medium to traditional VR, our results have implications for future head-mounted displays.",

The main processes include geometric calibration and alignment, image blending and the final projection. Firstly we proposed a two-step MR alignment scheme which estimates the transform matrix between input video streaming and the sand table for coarse alignment, and deforms the input frame using moving least squares for accurate alignment. To overcome the video border distinction problem, we make a border-adaptive image stitching with brightness diffusion to merge the overlapping area. With the projection, the video area can be mixed into the sand table in real-time to provide a live physical mixed reality model. We build a prototype to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This design could also be easily extended to large size with help of multiple projectors. The system proposed in this paper supports multiple user interaction in a broad area of applications such as surveillance, demonstration, action preview and discussion assistances.",

            "Abstract": "The most commonly used single point active alignment method (SPAAM) is based on a static pinhole camera model, in which it is assumed that both the eye and the HMD are fixed. This leads to a limitation for calibration precision. In this work, we propose a dynamic pinhole camera model according to the fact that the human eye would experience an obvious displacement over the whole calibration process. Based on such a camera model, we propose a new calibration data acquisition method called the region-induced data enhancement (RIDE) to revise the calibration data. The experimental results prove that the proposed dynamic model performs better than the traditional static model in actual calibration.",

In a spherical panorama, alignment of the scene orientation to the image axes is important for providing comfortable and pleasant viewing experiences using VR headsets and traditional displays. This paper presents an automatic framework for upright adjustment of 360 spherical panorama images without any prior information, such as depths and Gyro sensor data. We take the Atlanta world assumption and use the horizontal and vertical lines in the scene to formulate a cost function for upright adjustment. Our method produces visually pleasing results for a variety of real-world spherical panoramas in less than a second.",

VR simulators have been developed to assess and improve minimally invasive surgery (MIS) skills. While these simulators are currently being used, most skill evaluation methods are limited to measuring and computing performance metrics regarding the MIS tool tip movement. In this study, a VR simulator is developed to measure and analyze the movements of upper limb joints. The movement analysis from the first experiment suggests that the kinematic data of upper limb can be used to discriminate an expert surgeon from a novice trainee. The results from the second experiment show that the motion of non-dominant hand has a significant effect on the performance of dominant hand.",

Studies showed that the integration of visual and haptic cues follows maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Little effort focuses however on the mechanism of integrating force and vibrotactile cues. We thus investigated MLE’s suitability for integrating these cues. Within a VE, human users undertook 3D interaction of navigating a flying drone along a high-voltage transmission line for inspection. The users received individual force or vibrotactile cues, and their combinations in collocated and dislocated settings. The users’ task performance including completion time and accuracy was assessed under each individual cue and setting. The presence of the vibrotactile cue promoted a better performance than the force cue alone. This agreed with the applicability of tactile cues for sensing 3D surfaces, herein setting a baseline for using MLE. The task performance under the collocated setting indicated a degree of combining the individual cues. In contrast, the performance under the dislocated setting was alike under the individual vibrotactile cue. These observations imply a possible role of MLE in integrating force and vibrotactile cues for 3D user interaction within VEs.",

            "Abstract": "Interesting virtual environments that permit free exploration are rarely small. A number of techniques have been developed to allow people to walk in larger virtual spaces than permitted by physical extent of the virtual reality hardware, and in this paper we compare three such methods in terms of how they affect presence and spatial awareness. In our first psychophysical study, we compared two methods of reorientation and one method of redirected walking on subjects&#039; presence and spatial memory while navigating a pre-specified path. Our results suggested no difference between the two methods of reorientation but inferior performance of the redirected walking method. We further compared the two reorientation methods in a second psychophysical study involving free exploration and navigation in a large virtual environment. Our results provide criteria by which the choice of a locomotion method for navigating large virtual environments may be selected.",

            "Abstract": "This preliminary study surveys whether/which avatar body parts are visible in first-wave consumer virtual reality (VR) applications for the HTC Vive (n = 200). A simple coding schema for assessing avatar bodily coherence (ABC) is piloted and evaluated. Results provide a snapshot of ABC in popular high-end VR applications in Q3 2016. It is reported that 86.5% of sampled items feature fully invisible avatars, 9% depict hands only, and 4.5% feature a head, torso, or legs, but with some degree of bodily incoherence. Findings suggest that users may experience a sense of ownership and/or agency over their virtual actions even in the absence of visible avatar body parts. This informs research questions and hypotheses for future experimental enquiry into how bodily representation may interplay with user cognition, perceived virtual embodiment (body ownership illusion and sense of agency; body schema–image relations), and spatial telepresence. For instance: To what extent/under what conditions do the users of consumer VR systems demonstrate a sense of bodily vulnerability (a drive for bodily preservation) when no virtual body is present/visible?",

            "Abstract": "This paper summarizes the detailed paths of participants in redirected walking (RDW) curvature gain experiments. The experiments were carried out in a wave field synthesis (WFS) system of 5x6 meters. Some users were blindfolded and had to control their walking by acoustical cues only, others wore an Oculus Rift DK2 which presented them a virtual scenery in addition. A marker at the participant’s head allowed us to record the paths with our high-precision tracking system. The naive assumption of RDW with curvature gains would be that the test persons walk on the circumference of a circle, but the observed walking patterns were much more complex. Test persons showed very individual walking patterns while exploring the virtual environment. Many of these patterns may be explained as a sequence: 1. walk a few steps toward the assumed target position, 2. check for deviations, 3. adjust path to new assumed target position, which results in different patterns of various path curvature. The consequences for the application of RDW techniques are: Curvature gain tries to guide the users on a circular arc: the ”ideal path”, whereas the real paths are mostly outside of the circle of the ideal path. The deviations in the audio-only case are much larger than in the audio-visual case. The measured curvature gain thresholds systematically under-estimate the required walking space, as they do not account for the required extra space for walking outside the circular path.",

We ex-amine three visualizations: rendering a matching virtual ball, the predicted trajectory of the ball, and a target catching point lying on the predicted trajectory. In our demonstration system, we track the projectile motion of a ball as it is being tossed between users. Using Unscented Kalman Filtering, we generate predictive estimates of the ball’s motion as it approaches the catcher. The predictive assistance visualizations effectively increases the user’s senses but can also alter the user’s strategy in catching.",

            "Abstract": "The objective of this research is to compare the effectiveness of different tracking devices underwater. There have been few works in aquatic virtual reality (VR) - i.e., VR systems that can be used in a real underwater environment. Moreover, the works that have been done have noted limitations on tracking accuracy. Our initial test results suggest that inertial measurement units work well underwater for orientation tracking but a different approach is needed for position tracking. Towards this goal, we have waterproofed and evaluated several consumer tracking systems intended for gaming to determine the most effective approaches. First, we informally tested infrared systems and fiducial marker based systems, which demonstrated significant limitations of optical approaches. Next, we quantitatively compared inertial measurement units (IMU) and a magnetic tracking system both above water (as a baseline) and underwater. By comparing the devices’ rotation data, we have discovered that the magnetic tracking system implemented by the Razer Hydra is more accurate underwater as compared to a phone-based IMU. This suggests that magnetic tracking systems should be further explored for underwater VR applications.",

It proposes the Diminished Reality (DR) method for an acceleration stimulus to reduce motion sickness for the autonomous vehicle. One of the main causes of motion sickness is a repeated acceleration. In order to diminish the acceleration stimulus in the autonomous vehicle, vection illusion is used to induce the user to make a preliminary movement against the real acceleration. The Balance Wii Board is used to measure participant&#039;s movement of the center of gravity to verify the effectiveness of the method with vection. The experimental result of 9 participants shows that the proposed method of using vection could reduce acceleration stimulus compared with the conventional method.",

            "Abstract": "Up to now, most driving simulators use either small monitors or large immersive projection setups like 2D/3D screens or a CAVE. The recent improvements of VR-HMDs led to an increased application in driving simulation. However, the influence and comparability of various VR and non-VR displays has been hardly investigated.  We present results of a user study investigating the different influence of non-VR (2D, stereoscopic 3D) and VR (HMD) on physiological responses, simulation sickness, and driving performance within a single driving simulator. In the study, 94 participants performed the Lane Change Task.  Results indicate that a VR-HMD leads to similar data as stereoscopic 3D or 2D screens. We observed no significant difference regarding physiological responses or lane change performance. However, we measured significantly increased simulator sickness in the VR-HMD condition compared to stereoscopic 3D.",

The intensity of cutaneous sensation evoked by airflow during the real and virtual walk was measured. The airflow stimulus was added to the participant with passive vestibular motion and visual presentation. The result suggests that the sensation of walking was strongly increased by adding the airflow stimulus to the vestibular and optic presentations. The cutaneous sensation of airflow was perceived higher for the sitting participant than during a real walk in both a single and the combined stimuli. The equivalent speed of airflow for the sitting participant was lowered from the airflow speed in the real walk.",

Perceptual disturbances are subjective in nature, and difficult to communicate verbally. Often caretakers or those closest to sufferers have difficulty understanding the nature of their suffering. Immersion provides an exciting opportunity to directly communicate percepts with clinicians and loved ones. Here, we present a prototype environment meant to simulate some of the perceptual disturbances associated with seizures and epilepsy. Following further validation of our approach, we hope to promote awareness and empathy for these often jarring phenomena.",

Approaches had been found to provide users with better dimensional perception. One method used in head-mounted displays is to interact by walking with visual feedback, but it is not suitable for a CAVE-like system, like imseCAVE with confined spaces for walking. A verbal corrective feedback mechanism is proposed. The result shows that estimation accuracy generally improves after eight feedback trials although some estimations become overestimated. One possible explanation is the need of more verbal feedback trials. Further research on top-down approach for improvement in depth perception is suggested.",

            "Abstract": "The frame rate of existing stereo cameras is not enough to track quick hand or finger actions. It also requires lots of computational cost to find correspondence between stereo images to compute distance. The recently commercialized 3D position sensors such as TOF cameras or Leap Motion needs strong illumination to ensure sufficient optical energy for the high frame rate sensing. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes to use a pair of optical-mouse-sensors as a stereo image sensor to measure 3D-velocity and use it to extrapolate 3D position measured by a low-frame-rate stereo camera. It is shown that quick hand actions are tracked under ordinary in-door lighting condition. As 2D velocities are computed inside the optical-mouse-sensors, computation and communication costs are drastically reduced.",

            "Abstract": "We present Gauntlet, a travel technique for immersive environments that uses non-dominant hand tracking and a fist gesture to translate and rotate the viewport. The technique allows for simultaneous use of the dominant hand for other spatial input tasks. Applications of Gauntlet include FPS games, and other application domains where navigation should be performed together with other tasks. We release the technique along with an example application, a VR horror game, as an open source project.",

            "Abstract": "Traditionally, experimental economics uses controlled and incentivized field and lab experiments to analyze economic behavior. However, investigating peer effects in the classic settings is challenging due to the reflection problem: Who is influencing whom? To overcome this, we enlarge the methodological toolbox of these experiments by means of Virtual Reality. After introducing and validating a real-effort sorting task, we embed a virtual agent as peer of a human subject, who independently performs an identical sorting task. We conducted two experiments investigating (a) the subject’s productivity adjustment due to peer effects and (b) the incentive effects on competition. Our results indicate a great potential for Virtual-Reality-based economic experiments.",

Then combined with the movement of liquid, we generate seed-particles which represent bubbles, foams or splashes. Next, we assign each seed-particles a radius with a new radius distribution model. By calculating the bubbles’ pressure wave we generate the sound. Experiments demonstrated that our novel framework can efficiently synthesize the sounds for natural scenes.",

It runs in a custom driving simulation and allows drivers to perceive otherwise occluded objects of the environment through the car body. We expect to obtain insights that will be relevant to future real-world applications. We conducted a pre-study with participants performing a driving task with the prototype in a CAVE-like virtual environment. Users preferred large-sized see-through areas over small ones but had differing opinions on the level of transparency to use. In future work, we plan additional evaluations of the driving performance and will further extend the simulation.",

            "Abstract": "Learning “motion” online or from video tutorials is usually inefficient since it is difficult to deliver “motion” information in traditional ways and in the ordinary PC platform. This paper presents ImmerTai, a system that can efficiently teach motion, in particular Chinese Taichi motion, in various immersive environments. ImmerTai captures the Taichi expert’s motion and delivers to students the captured motion in multi-modal forms in immersive CAVE, HMD as well as ordinary PC environments. The students’ motions are captured too for quality assessment and utilized to form a virtual collaborative learning atmosphere. We built up a Taichi motion dataset with 150 fundamental Taichi motions captured from 30 students, on which we evaluated the learning effectiveness and user experience of ImmerTai. The results show that ImmerTai can enhance the learning efficiency by up to 17.4% and the learning quality by up to 32.3%.",

In the planned experiment, subjects are immersed with HMD and full body motion capture in a virtual world exhibiting either normal gravity or the apparent absence of gravity (i.e. body and objects floating in space). The study evaluates changes in the subjects’ gravity model by observing changes on motor planning of actions dependent on gravity. Our goal is to demonstrate that a virtual reality exposure can induce some modifications to the humans internal gravity model, even if users remain under normal gravity condition in reality.",

We mounted the HMD on a pendulum to introduce damped sinusoidal motion to the HMD during the pendulum swing. The latency was estimated by calculating the phase shift between the captured signals of the physical motion of the HMD and a motion-dependent gradient stimulus rendered on the display. We used the proposed method to estimate both rotational and translational Motion-to-Photon latencies of the Oculus Rift DK2.",

Based on previous research on spatial memory in immersive virtual reality (VR) we ran a study that looked at the effect of three locomotion techniques (joystick, pointing-and-teleporting and walking-in-place) on object location learning and recall. Participants were asked to learn the location of a virtual object in a virtual environment (VE). After a short period of time they were asked to recall the location by placing a real version of the object in the real-world equivalent environment. Results indicate that the average placement error, or distance between original and recalled object location, is approximately 20cm for all locomotion technique conditions. This result is similar to the outcome of a previous study on spatial memory in VEs that used real walking. We report this unexpected finding and suggest further work on spatial memory in VR by recommending the replication of this study in different environments and using objects with a wider diversity of properties, including varying sizes and shapes.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a simple but effective way of enhancing tactile stimulus by a mechanism with springs to preserve elastic energies charged in a prior energy-charging phase and discharge them to enhance the force to hit a finger in the stimulating phase. With this mechanism, a small and light stimulator attached to the fingertip is developed and demonstrated to generate the tactile feedback strong enough to make people feel as if their fingers collide with a virtual object. It is also shown that the durations of the two phases can be as short as a few milliseconds so that the latency in tactile feedback can be negligible. The performance of the mechanism and the effectiveness of its tactile feedback are evaluated for in-air key-press and swipe operations.",

            "Abstract": "The use of non-verbal vocal input (NVVI) as a hand-free trigger approach has proven to be valuable in previous work [Zielasko2015]. Nevertheless, BlowClick&#039;s original detection method is vulnerable to false positives and, thus, is limited in its potential use, e.g., together with acoustic feedback for the trigger. Therefore, we extend the existing approach by adding common machine learning methods. We found that a support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel performs best for detecting blowing with at least the same latency and more precision as before. Furthermore, we added acoustic feedback to the NVVI trigger, which increases the user&#039;s confidence. To evaluate the advanced trigger technique, we conducted a user study (n=33). The results confirm that it is a reliable trigger; alone and as part of a hands-free point-and-click interface.",

Cooking is important for children to learn about what they eat. In addition, that is also important for daily communication between children and their parents. However, it is dangerous for young children to handle cooking knives. Because of this danger, parents often try to keep their young children away from the kitchen. Our proposed system will contribute to not only improving children’s cooking skills, but also improving communication between parents and children. The system composed of a virtual knife with haptic feedback function, a touch/force sensitive virtual food and a two-dimensional force sensitive cutting board. This system was developed to teach a fundamental cutting method, the “thrusting cut”. This paper describes the detail of the system.",

            "Abstract": "Simulator sickness is an issue in virtual reality environments. In a virtual world, sensory conflict between visual sensation and self-motion perception occurs readily. Contradiction between visual and vestibular sensation is a dominant cause of motion sickness. Vection is a visually evoked illusion of self-motion. Vection occurs when a stationary human experiences locomotor stimulation over a wider area of the field of view, and senses motion when in fact there is none. Strong vection has been associated with simulator sickness. In this poster, the authors present results of a pilot study based on a hypothesis that simulator sickness can be mitigated by passively responding to the body sway. Commercially available air cushions were applied for VR environments. Measurable mitigation of simulator sickness was achieved by physically responding to vection. Allowing body sway encourages moder-ating the sensory conflict between visual sensation and self-motion perception. Also, the shapes of air cushions on seat backs were found to be an important variable.",

            "Abstract": "Here we describe the design and usability evaluation of a mixed reality prototype to simulate the role of a tank platoon leader, who is an individual who not only is a tank commander, but also directs a platoon of three other tanks with their own respective tank commanders. The domain of tank commander training has relied on physical simulators of the actual Abrams tank and encapsulates the whole crew. The TALK-ON system we describe here focuses on training communication skills of the leader in a simulated tank crew. We report results from a usability evaluation and discuss how they will inform our future work for collective tank training.",

Static error compensation is applied to the lower-priority tracking systems when high-priority trackers are not available. The method does not require high-end or carefully calibrated tracking units, and is able to effectively provide a comfortable augmented reality experience for users. A pilot study demonstrates the validity of the proposed method.",

            "Abstract": "Spherical data compression methods for Virtual Reality (VR) currently leverage popular rectangular data encoding algorithms. Traditional compression algorithms have massive adoption and hardware support on computers and mobile devices. Efficiently utilizing these two-dimensional compression methods for spherical data necessitates a projection from the three-dimensional surface of a sphere to a two-dimensional rectangle. Any such projection affects the final resolution distribution of the data after decoding. Popular projections used for VR video benefit from mathematical or geometric simplicity, but result in suboptimal resolution distributions. We introduce a method for generating a projection to match a desired resolution function. This method allows for customized projections with smooth, continuous and optimal resolution functions. Compared to commonly used projections, our resolution-defined projections drastically improve compression ratios for any given quality.",

To address this problem, the video quality is adjusted according to the user viewport prediction. High quality video is only streamed for the user viewport, reducing the overall bandwidth consumption. Existing solutions use shallow buffers limited by the accuracy of viewport prediction. Therefore, playback is prone to video freezes which are very destructive for the Quality of Experience(QoE). We propose using layered encoding for 360-degree video to improve QoE by reducing the probability of video freezes and the latency of response to the user head movements. Moreover, this scheme reduces the storage requirements significantly and improves in-network cache performance.",

            "Abstract": "View management techniques are commonly used for labelling of objects in augmented reality environments. Combining with image analysis, search space and adaptive representations, they can be utilized to achieve desired labelling tasks. However, the evaluation of different search space methods on labelling are still an open problem. In this paper, we propose an image analysis based view management method, which first adopts the image processing to superimpose 2D labels to the specific object. We then conduct three search space methods to an augmented reality scenario. Without the requirements of setting rules and constraints for occlusion among the labels, the results of three search space methods are evaluated by using objective analysis of related parameters. The evaluation results indicate that different search space methods could generate different time costs and occlusion, thereby affecting the final labelling effects.",

            "Abstract": "For live television broadcast such as the educational program for children conducted through viewer participation, the smooth integration of virtual contents and the interaction between the casts and them are quite important issues. Recently there have been many attempts to make aggressive use of interactive virtual contents in live broadcast due to the advancement of AR/VR technology and virtual studio technology. These previous works have many limitations that do not support real-time 3D space recognition or immersive interaction. In this sense, we propose an augmented reality based real-time broadcasting system which perceives the indoor space using a broadcasting camera and a RGB-D camera. Also, the system can support the real-time interaction between the augmented virtual contents and the casts. The contribution of this work is the development of a new augmented reality based broadcasting system that not only enables filming using compatible interactive 3D contents in live broadcast but also drastically reduces the production costs. For the practical use, the proposed system was demonstrated in the actual broadcast program called “Ding Dong Dang Kindergarten” which is a representative children educational program on the national broadcasting channel of Korea.",

            "Abstract": "Coloring book can inspire imaginary and creativity of children. However, with the rapid development of digital devices and internet, traditional coloring book tends to be not attractive for children any more. Thus, we propose an idea of applying augmented reality technology to traditional coloring book. After children finish coloring characters in the printed coloring book, they can inspect their work using a mobile device. The drawing is detected and tracked so that the video stream is augmented with a 3D character textured according to their coloring. This is possible thanks to several novel technical contributions. We present a texture process that generates texture map for 3D augmented reality character from 2D colored drawing using a lookup map. Considering the movement of the mobile device and drawing, we give an efficient method to track the drawing surface.",

It describes the technical spectrum of cyber-archeology process applied to the creation of a fully immersive and interactive virtual environment (VE), which represents Itapeva Rocky Shelter, a prehistoric archeological site in Brazil. The workflow starts with a real world data capture – laser scanners, drones and photogrammetry, continues with the transposition of the captured information into a 3D surface model capable of real-time rendering to head-mounted displays (HMDs), and ends with the design of interactive features allowing users to experience the virtual archeological site. The main objective of this VR model is to make plausible to general public to feel what it means to explore an otherwise restricted and ephemeral place. As final thoughts it is reported on preliminary results from an initial user observation.",

A 360 degree video of a live rock concert from a local band was recorded. Single sound sources from the stage and the PA system were recorded, as well as the audience noise, and impulse responses of the concert venue. The audience noise was imple- mented in the production phase. A comparative study compared an experience with and without audience noise. In a between sub- ject experiment with 30 participants we found that audience noise does not have a significant impact on presence. However, qualita- tive evaluations show that the naturalness of the sonic experience delivered through wavefield synthesis had a positive impact on the participants.",

            "Abstract": "Immersive technologies such as 360◦ cameras and head-mounted displays (HMDs) have become affordable to the average consumer, opening up new audiences for storytellers. However, existing immersive post-production software often requires too great a technical or financial investment for smaller creative shops, including most of the country’s newspapers and local broadcast journalism organizations. Game engines, for example, are unnecessarily complicated for simple 360◦ video projects. Introducing Immerj - an open source abstraction layer simplifying the Unity3D game engine’s interface for immersive content creators. Our primary collaborator, Professor R.B. Brenner, director of the School of Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, organized hands-on demos with our team and journalists and designers from some of the top news organizations all over the country in order to follow a human-centered design process. In just over one year, a small team of undergraduate researchers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) has created a potentially disruptive democratization of technology.",

Besides looking to the plastic and textual factors perceived by the users in the Virtual Environment (VE), this work also reflects about effects of immersion provided by different technological devices and its possible influences in the advertising message reception process – a head-mounted display (Oculus Rift DK2), a cavern automatic virtual environment (CAVE) and a desktop monitor (PC). To carry this empirical experiment, a 3D scenario that simulates a real city urban space was created and several advertising image formats were inserted on its landscape. User navigation through the urban space was designed in a first-person perspective. In short, we intend to accomplish two objectives: a) to identify which factors lead people to pay attention to adverting in immersive VE; b) to verify the immersion effects produced by different VR interfaces in the perception of advertising.",

The term Magic Mirror implies that the display shows the users enantiomorph, i.e. the mirror image, such that the system mimics a real-world physical mirror. However, the question arises whether one should design a traditional mirror, or instead display the true mirror image by means of a non-reversing mirror? We discuss the perceptual differences between these two mirror visualization concepts and present a first comparative study in the context of Magic Mirror anatomy teaching.",

In this research, we designed and evaluated three different scene transition techniques in two environments, conducted a pilot study, and collected metrics related to sickness, spatial orientation, and preference. Our preliminary results indicate that faster techniques are generally preferred by gamers and more gradual transitions are preferred by participants with less experience with 3D gaming and virtual reality.",

Does virtual spatial navigation, when paired with learning cues, enhance information encoding relative to nonspatial and nonvirtual processes? A pilot study was executed comparing recall on non-navigational memorization processes to processes involving mental and virtual navigation and we are currently running a full study to see if we can replicate these effects with a more demanding memory task and refined study design.",

            "Abstract": "There are few effective treatments for rehabilitation of severe motor impairment after stroke. We developed a novel closed-loop neurofeedback system called REINVENT to promote motor recovery in this population. REINVENT (Rehabilitation Environment using the Integration of Neuromuscular-based Virtual Enhancements for Neural Training) harnesses recent advances in neuroscience, wearable sensors, and virtual technology and integrates low-cost electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) sensors with feedback in a head-mounted virtual reality display (VR) to provide neurofeedback when an individual’s neuromuscular signals indicate movement attempt, even in the absence of actual movement. Here we describe the REINVENT prototype and provide evidence of the feasibility and safety of using REINVENT with older adults.",

Avatars also become increasingly more relevant in VR as they provide a user with an identity for social interactions in multi-user settings. However, with current consumer VR setups that include only a head mounted display and hand controllers, implementation of self avatars are generally limited in the ability to mimic actions performed in the real world. Our work explores the idea of simulating a wide range of upper body motions using motion and positional data from only the head and hand motion data. We present a method to differentiate head and hip motions using information from captured motion data and applying corresponding changes to a virtual avatar. We discuss our approach and initial results.",

The haptic primary colors principle is a concept of decomposing the human sensation of tactile feeling into force, vibration, and temperature. Images were obtained from variation in the frequency of the time series of the tactile feeling obtained when tracing a surface of an object, features were extracted by employing a stacked autoencoder using a neural network with two hidden layers, and supervised learning was conducted. We confirmed that the tactile feeling for three different surface materials can be classified with an accuracy of 82.0[%].",

A viewpoint change function is desirable when a learner observes the actions using video images. However, in general, viewpoint changes for observation are not possible because most videos are filmed from a fixed point using a single video camera. The objective of this research is to develop a method that generates a 3D human model of a player (i.e., a virtual player) from a single image and enable observation of the virtual player&#039;s action from any point of view. As a first step, this study focused on karate training and developed a semiautomatic method for 3D reconstruction from video images of sparring in karate.",

The backbone of the project is to pursue an alternative constructivist pedagogical model for learning canine anatomy. The main focus of the study was to identify and assemble bones in the live-animal orientation, using real thoracic limb bones in a bone box and digital pelvic limb bones in the Anatomy Builder VR. Eleven college students participated in the study. The pilot study showed that participants most enjoyed interacting with anatomical contents within the VR program. Participants spent less time assembling bones in the VR, and instead spent a longer time tuning the orientation of each VR bone in the 3D space.

However, it is unclear whether the motor skills learned in HMD-VR transfer to the non-virtual world and vice-versa. Here we used a well-established test of skilled motor learning, the Sequential Visual Isometric Pinch Task (SVIPT), to train individuals in either an HMD-VR or conventional training (CT) environment. Participants were then tested in both environments. Our results show that participants who train in the CT environment have an improvement in motor performance when they transfer to the HMD-VR environment. In contrast, participants who train in the HMD-VR environment show a decrease in skill level when transferring to the CT environment. This has implications for how training in HMD-VR and CT may affect performance in different environments.",

AR is a key user-interface technology for personalized, situated information delivery, navigation, on-demand instruction and games. The widespread availability and rapid evolution of smartphones and new devices such as Hololens enables software-only solutions for AR, where it was previously necessary to assemble custom hardware solutions. However, ergonomic and technical limitations of existing devices make this a challenging endeavor. In particular, it is necessary to design novel efficient real-time computer vision and computer graphics algorithms, and create new lightweight forms of interaction with the environment through small form-factor devices. This tutorial will present selected technical achievements in this field and highlight some examples of successful application prototypes.",

We will closely look into the basics of navigation, unraveling the psychophysics (including wayfinding) and actual navigation (travel) aspects. The theoretical foundations form the basis for the practical skill set we will develop, by providing an in-depth discussion of navigation devices and techniques, and a step-by-step discussion of multiple real-world case studies. Doing so, we will cover the full range of navigation techniques from handheld to full-body, highly engaging and partly unconventional methods and tackle spatial navigation with hands-on-experience and tips for design and validation of novel interfaces. In particular, we will be looking at affordable setups, rapid prototyping methods and ways to “trick” out users to enable a realistic feeling of self-motion in the explored environments. As such, the course unites the theory and practice of spatial navigation, serving as entry point to understand and improve upon currently existing methods for the application domain at hand.",

We leverage a user&#039;s knowledge of touch gestures like pinching, swiping, etc. and physical device movement to interact with the environment making the metaphor intuitive. The system helps prevent occlusion by using the accelerometer and allowing touch gestures anywhere on the screen. The interaction metaphor allows for successful art piece creation and assembly.",

In this work, we focused on the design of a suitable interface for Augmented Reality-based constructive art on handheld devices. Issues to be faced encompassed how to give artists sense of spatial dimensions, how to provide them with different tools for realizing artworks, and how much moving away from ``the real&#039;&#039; and going towards ``the virtual&#039;&#039;. Through a touch-capable device, such as a smartphone or a tablet, we offer artists a clean workspace, where they can decide when to introduce artworks and tools. In fact, besides exploiting the multi-touch functionality and the gyroscopes/accelerometers to manipulate artworks in six degrees of freedom (6DOF), the proposed solution exploits a set of printed markers that can be brought into the camera&#039;s field of view to make specific virtual tools appear in the augmented scene. With such tools, artists can decide to control, e.g., manipulation speed, scale factor, scene parameters, etc., thus complementing functionalities that can be accessed via the device&#039;s screen.",

The set-up consists of a mobile device, an interactive wand marker and AR markers laid on a table. The system allows users to change viewpoint and execute operations on 3D objects - simultaneous translation and rotation, scaling, cloning or deleting - by unconstrained natural interactions, leveraging user’s proficiency on daily object manipulation tasks and speeding up such typical 3D manipulation operations. Depth perception was significantly enhanced with dynamic shadows, allowing fast alignment and accurate positioning of objects. The prototype presented here allows successful completion of the three challenges proposed by the 2017 3DUI Contest, as validated by a preliminary informal user study with participants from the target audience and also from the general public.",

            "Abstract": "Interaction in augmented reality environments may be very complex, depending on the degrees of freedom (DOFs) required for the task. In this work we present a 3D user interface for collaborative manipulation of virtual objects in augmented reality (AR) environments. It maps position -- acquired with a camera and fiducial markers -- and touchscreen input of a handheld device into gestures to select, move, rotate and scale virtual objects. As these transformations require the control of multiple DOFs, collaboration is proposed as a solution to coordinate the modification of each and all the available DOFs. Users are free to decide their own manipulation roles. All virtual elements are displayed directly on the mobile device as an overlay of the camera capture, providing an individual point of view of the AR environment to each user.",

            "Abstract": "Virtual Reality experiments have enabled immersed users to perform virtual tasks in a Virtual Environment (VE). Before beginning a task, however, users must locate and select the different objects they will need in the VE. This first step is important and affects global performance in the virtual task. If a user takes too long to locate and select an object, the duration of the task is increased. Moreover, both the comfort and global efficiency of users deteriorate as search and selection time increase. We have developed Pano, a technique which reduces this time by increasing the user’s “natural” field of view. More precisely, we provide a 360° panoramic virtual image which is displayed on a specific window, called the PanoWindow. Thanks to the PanoWindow, users can perceive and interact with the part of the Virtual Environment (VE) that is behind them without any additional head or body movement. In this paper, we present two user studies with 30 and 21 participants in different VEs. For the first study, participants were invited to perform object-finding tasks with and without Pano. The second study involved position-estimating tasks in order to know if the PanoWindow image enables users to build an accurate representation of the environment. First, the results show that Pano both reduces task duration and improves user comfort. Second, they demonstrate that good object-localization accuracy can be achieved using Pano.",

            "Abstract": "Space available for any virtual reality experience is often strictly limited and abridges the virtual world to a size of a room. To extend the amount of virtual space accessible by walking within the same real workspace the methods of spatial compression were proposed. Scene manipulation with a controlled spatial overlap has been shown to be an efficient method. However, in order to apply space compression effectively for a dynamic, scalable and robust 3D user interface, it is important to study how the human perceives different layouts with overlapping spaces.  In this paper, we explore the influence of the properties of the layout used on human spatial perception in a physically impossible spatial arrangement. Our first reported study focuses on the following parameters of the path within a simple self-overlapping layout: number of turns, relative door positions, sequences of counter- and clockwise turns, symmetry and asymmetry of the path used. In addition, in the second study we explore the effect of path smoothing by substituting the right-angled corridors by smooth curves. Our studies show that usage of the smooth curved corridors is more beneficial for spatial compression than the conventional right-angled approach.",

            "Abstract": "We propose an approach to greatly increase the tracking workspace of VR applications without adding new sensors. Our approach relies on controlled cameras able to follow the tracked markers all around the VR workspace providing 6DoF tracking data. We designed the proof-of-concept of such approach based on two consumer-grade cameras and a pan-tilt head. The resulting tracking workspace could be greatly increased depending on the actuators’ range of motion. The accuracy error and jitter were found to be rather limited during camera motion (resp. 0.3cm and 0.02cm). Therefore, whenever the final VR application does not require a perfect tracking accuracy over the entire workspace, we recommend using our approach in order to enlarge the tracking workspace.",

The device employs inertial sensors to derive a 3D cursor position through natural arm movement. We also explore three methods of indicating selection with the device, one entirely software based (dwell), one using a twist gesture, and one relying on buttons. To address the paucity of research reporting human performance metrics across comparable interfaces, we quantify the performance of this new device through a point selection experiment and compare results from a similar study.",

            "Abstract": "While experiencing an immersive virtual environment a suitable trigger metaphor is often needed, e.g. for the interaction with objects out of physical reach or system control. The BlowClick approach [Zielasko2015] that is based on non-verbal vocal input has been proven to be a valuable trigger technique in previous work. However, its original detection method is vulnerable to false positives and, thus, is limited in its potential use. Therefore, we extended the existing approach by adding machine learning methods to reliably classify blowing events. We found a support vector machine with Gaussian kernel performing the best with at least the same latency and more precision than before. Furthermore, we added acoustic feedback to the NVVI trigger, which increases the user’s confidence and whose absence was also stated as a limitation of the previous work. With this extended technique, we repeated the conducted Fitts’ law experiment with 33 participants and could confirm that it is possible to use NVVI as a reliable trigger as part of a hands-free point-andclick interface. Furthermore, we tested reaction times to measure the trigger’s performance without the influence of pointing and calculated device throughputs to ensure comparability.",

            "Abstract": "Object selection and manipulation in world-fixed displays such as CAVE-type systems are typically achieved with tracked input devices, which lack the tangibility of real-world interactions. Conversely, due to the visual blockage of the real world, head-mounted displays allow the use of many types of real world objects that can convey realistic haptic feedback. To bridge this gap, we propose Specimen Box, an interaction technique that allows users to naturally hold a plausible physical object while manipulating virtual content inside it. This virtual content is rendered based on the tracked position of the box in relation to the user&#039;s point of view. Specimen Box provides the weight and tactile feel of an actual object and does not occlude rendered objects in the scene. The end result is that the user sees the virtual content as if it exists inside the clear physical box. We hypothesize that the effect of holding a physical box, which is a valid part of the overall scenario, would improve user performance and experience. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted a user study which involved a cognitively loaded inspection task requiring extensive manipulation of the box. We compared Specimen Box to Grab-and-Twirl, a naturalistic bimanual manipulation technique that closely mimics the mechanics of our proposed technique. Results show that in our specific task, performance was significantly faster and rotation rate was significantly lower with Specimen Box. Further, performance of the control technique was positively affected by experience with Specimen Box.",

In a 2 x 2 experiment design, we investigated a large-screen immersive display (LSID) with a head-mounted display (HMD), and the presence versus absence of gravity. Advantages of the HMD include interacting with the simulation in a more natural manner as compared to using a large-screen immersive display due to the similarities between the interactions afforded in the virtual compared to the real-world task. Suspending the laws of physics may have an effect on usability and in turn could affect learning outcomes. Our dependent variables consisted of a pre and post cognition questionnaire, quantitative performance measures, perceived workload and system usefulness, and a psychomotor assessment to measure to what extent transfer of learning took place from the virtual to the real world. Results indicate that the HMD condition was preferable to the immersive display in several metrics while the no-gravity condition resulted in users adopting strategies that were not advantageous for task performance.",

To this end, two closely linked factors have to be considered for the agents’ behavioral design: their presence time (PT), i.e., the time in which the agents are visible, and the approaching time (AT), i.e., the time span between the user’s calling for an agent and the agent’s actual availability.  This work focuses on human-like assistants that are embedded in immersive scenes but that are required only temporarily. To the best of our knowledge, guidelines for a suitable trade-off between PT and AT of these assistants do not yet exist. We address this gap by presenting the results of a controlled within-subjects study in a CAVE. While keeping a low PT so that the agent is not perceived as annoying, three strategies affecting the AT, namely fading, walking, and running, are evaluated by 40 subjects. The results indicate no clear preference for either behavior. Instead, the necessity of a better trade-off between a low AT and an agent’s realistic behavior is demonstrated.",

We compared a standard non-motion cueing interface, Joystick (Xbox), with four motion cueing interfaces, NaviChair (stool with springs), MuvMan (sit/stand active stool), Head-Directed (Oculus Rift DK2), and Swivel Chair (everyday office chair with leaning capability). Each interface had two degrees of freedom to move forward/backward and rotate using velocity (rate) control. The aim of this mixed methods study was to better understand relevant user experience factors and guide the design of future locomotion interfaces. This study employed methods from HCI to provide an understanding of why users behave a certain way while using the interface and to unearth any new issues with the design. Participants were tasked to search for objects in a virtual city while they provided talk-aloud feedback and we logged their behaviour. Subsequently, they completed a post-experimental questionnaire on their experience. We found that the qualitative themes of control, usability, and experience echoed the results of the questionnaire, providing internal validity. The quantitative measures revealed the Joystick to be significantly more comfortable and precise than the motion cueing interfaces. However, the qualitative feedback and interviews showed this was due to the reduced perceived controllability and safety of the motion cueing interfaces. Designers of these interfaces should consider using a backrest if users need to lean backwards and avoid using velocity-control for rotations when using HMDs.",

            "Abstract": "Proper integration of sensory cues facilitates 3D user interaction within virtual environments (VEs). Studies on multi-sensory integration of visual and haptic cues revealed that the integration follows maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Little effort focuses however on integrating force and vibrotactile cues – two sub-categorical cues of the haptic modality. Hence, this paper presents an investigation on MLE’s suitability for integrating these sub-categorical cues. Within a stereoscopic VE, human users performed a 3D interactive task of navigating a flying drone along a high-voltage transmission line in an inaccessible region and identifying defects on the line. The users had to identify defects via individual force or vibrotactile cues, and their combinations in co-located and dislocated settings. The co-located setting provided both cues on the right hand of the users; whereas the dislocated setting delivered the force and vibrotactile cues on the right hand and forearm of the users, respectively. Task performance of the users, such as completion time and accuracy, was assessed under each cue and setting. The presence of the vibrotactile cue promoted a better performance than the force cue alone. This was in agreement with the role of tactile cues in sensing surface properties, herein setting a baseline for using MLE. The task performance under the co-located setting indicated certain degrees of combining those under the individual cues. In contrast, the performance under the dislocated setting was alike that under the individual vibrotactile cue. These observations imply an inconclusiveness of MLE to integrate both cues in a co-located setting for 3D user interaction.",

            "Abstract": "In virtual reality (VR), spatial awareness is a dominant research topic. It plays an essential role in the assessment of human operators’ behavior within virtual environments (VE), notably for the evaluation of the feasibility of manual maintenance tasks in cluttered industrial settings. In such contexts, it is decisive to evaluate the spatial and temporal correspondence between the operator’s movement kinematics and that of his/her virtual avatar in the virtual environment. Often, in a cluttered VE, direct kinesthetic (force) feedback is limited or absent. We tested whether vibrotactile (cutaneous) feedback would increase visuo-proprioceptive consistency, spatial awareness, and thus the validity of VR studies, by augmenting the perception of the operator’s contact(s) with virtual objects. We present preliminary experimental results, obtained using a head-mounted display (HMD) during a goal-directed task in a cluttered VE. Data suggest that spatialized vibrotactile feedback contributes to visuo-proprioceptive consistency.",

            "Abstract": "3D interaction in virtual reality often requires to manipulate and feel virtual objects with our fingers. Although existing haptic interfaces can be used for this purpose (e.g. force-feedback exoskeleton gloves), they are still bulky and expensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-finger device called &quot;FlexiFingers&quot; that constrains each digit individually and produces elastic force-feedback. FlexiFingers leverages passive haptics in order to offer a lightweight, modular, and affordable alternative to active devices. Moreover, we combine Flexifingers with a pseudo-haptic approach that simulates different levels of stiffness when interacting with virtual objects. We illustrate how this combination of passive haptics and pseudo-haptics can benefit multi-finger interaction through several use cases related to music learning and medical training. Those examples suggest that our approach could find applications in various domains that require an accessible and portable way of providing haptic feedback to the fingers.",

            "Abstract": "The Hanger Reflex is a phenomenon in which the head rotates unintentionally when force is applied via a wire hanger placed on the head. This phenomenon is caused by physical pressure on the skin, and the direction of the Hanger Reflex modulated by the direction of skin deformation. A previous study examined the use of the head-, waist-, and ankle-type Hanger Reflex on walking navigation without interpretation of navigation information, and found that the waist-type Hanger Reflex had the strongest effect on walking. However, the existing waist-type Hanger Reflex device is passive; i.e. must be operated by the user, which leads to the necessity of developing a new active type device for use as part of a navigational system. In this paper, we developed a controlled waist-type Hanger Reflex device with four pneumatic actuators. We investigated different interpretations of navigation information on the effect of our device on walking. Our interpretation conditions included “Natural”, in which users did not attempt to interpret the navigation information, “Follow”, and “Resist”, in which they actively followed, or resisted the navigation information, respectively. We confirmed that our waist-type Hanger Reflex device could control the walking path and body direction, depending on user’s interpretation of the navigational information.",

The techniques, called Bookshelf and Bird, provide narrative-consistent redirection to keep the user inside the physical space, and require the user to walk to explore the VE. The underlying concept, called cell-based redirection, is to divide the virtual world into discrete cells that have the same size as the physical tracking space. The techniques then can redirect the users without altering the relationship between the user, the physical space, and the virtual cell. In this way, users can always access the entire cell using real walking.",

            "Abstract": "Redirected walking with advanced planners such as MPCRed or FORCE requires both knowledge about the virtual environment - mostly in the form of a skeleton graph representing the virtual environment - and a robust prediction of the user&#039;s actions. This paper presents methods for both parts and evaluates them with a number of test cases.  Since frame rate is crucial for a virtual reality application, the computationally heavy extraction and preprocessing of the skeleton graph is done offline while only parts directly linked to the user&#039;s behavior such as the prediction are done online. The prediction is done using a target-based long-term prediction and the targets are determined automatically and combined with targets predefined by the designer of the virtual environment.  The methods presented here provide a graph that is well suited for planning redirection and allows prediction techniques previously only demonstrated in studies to be applied to large scale virtual environments.",

            "Abstract": "Scene visibility - the information of which parts of the scene are visible from a certain location—can be used to derive various properties of a virtual environment. For example, it enables the computation of viewpoint quality to determine the informativeness of a viewpoint, helps in constructing virtual tours, and allows to keep track of the objects a user may already have seen. However, computing visibility at runtime may be too computationally expensive for many applications, while sampling the entire scene beforehand introduces a costly precomputation step and may include many samples not needed later on.  Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to precompute visibility information based on navigation meshes, a polygonal representation of a scene’s navigable areas. We show that with only limited precomputation, high accuracy can be achieved in these areas. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of the approach by means of several applications, including viewpoint quality computation, landmark and room detection, and exploration assistance. In addition, we present a travel interface based on common visibility that we found to result in less cybersickness in a user study.",

            "Abstract": "With the introduction of new input devices, a series of questions have been raised in regard to making user interaction more intuitive -- in particular, preferred gestures for different tasks. Our study looks into how to find a gesture set for 3D travel using a multi-touch display and a mid-air device to improve user interaction. We conducted a user study with 30 subjects, concluding that users preferred simple gestures for multi-touch. In addition, we found that multi-touch user legacy carried over mid-Air interaction. Finally, we propose a gesture set for both type of interactions.",

            "Abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) is again in the spotlight. However, interactions and modeling operations are still major hurdles to its complete success. To make VR Interaction viable, many have proposed mid-air techniques because of their naturalness and resemblance to physical world operations. Still, natural mid-air metaphors for Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) are still elusive. This is unfortunate, because CSG is a powerful enabler for more complex modeling tasks, allowing to create complex objects from simple ones via Boolean operations. Moreover, Head-Mounted Displays occlude the real self, and make it difficult for users to be aware of their relationship to the virtual environment. In this paper we propose two new techniques to achieve Boolean operations between two objects in VR. One is based on direct-manipulation via gestures while the other uses menus. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of these techniques. Due to tracking limitations, results allowed no significant conclusions to be drawn. To account for self-representation, we compared full-body avatar against an iconic cursor depiction of users&#039; hands. In this matter, the simplified hands-only representation improved efficiency in CSG modelling tasks.",

            "Abstract": "Advances in motion tracking technology, especially for commodity hardware, still require robust 3D gesture recognition in order to fully exploit the benefits of natural user interfaces. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D gesture recognition algorithm based on the sparse representation of 3D human motion. The sparse representation of human motion provides a set of features that can be used to efficiently classify gestures in real-time. Compared to existing gesture recognition systems, sparse representation, the proposed approach enables full spatial and rotation invariance and provides high tolerance to noise. Moreover, the proposed classification scheme takes into account the inter-user variability which increases gesture classification accuracy in user-independent scenarios. We validated our approach with existing motion databases for gestural interaction and performed a user evaluation with naive subjects to show its robustness to arbitrarily defined gestures. The results showed that our classification scheme has high classification accuracy for user-independent scenarios even with users who have different handedness. We believe that sparse representation of human motion will pave the way for a new generation of 3D gesture recognition systems in order to fully open the potential of natural user interfaces.",

            "Abstract": "Handheld Augmented Reality commonly implements some variant of magic lens rendering, which turns only a fraction of the user’s real environment into AR while the rest of the environment remains unaffected. Since handheld AR devices are commonly equipped with video see-through capabilities, AR magic lens applications often suffer from spatial distortions, because the AR environment is presented from the perspective of the camera of the mobile device. Recent approaches counteract this distortion based on estimations of the user’s head position, rendering the scene from the user&#039;s perspective. To this end, approaches usually apply face-tracking algorithms on the front camera of the mobile device. However, this demands high computational resources and therefore commonly affects the performance of the application beyond the already high computational load of AR applications. In this paper, we present a method to reduce the computational demands for user perspective rendering by applying lightweight optical flow tracking and an estimation of the user’s motion before head tracking is started. We demonstrate the suitability of our approach for computationally limited mobile devices and we compare it to device perspective rendering, to head tracked user perspective rendering, as well as to fixed point of view user perspective rendering.",

            "Abstract": "Drawing annotations with 3D hand gestures in augmented reality are useful for creating visual and spatial references in the real world, especially when these gestures can be issued from a distance. Different techniques exist for highlighting physical objects with hand-drawn circle and arrow annotations from a distance, assuming an approximate 3D scene model (e.g., as provided by the Microsoft HoloLens). However, little is known about user preference and performance of such methods for annotating real-world 3D environments. In this paper, we compare different annotation methods using the HoloLens augmented reality development platform: Surface-Drawing and Air-Drawing, with either raw but smoothed or interpreted and beautified gesture input. For the Surface-Drawing method, users control a cursor that is projected onto the world model, allowing gesture input to occur directly on the surfaces of real-world objects. For the Air-Drawing method, gesture drawing occurs at the user&#039;s fingertip and is projected onto the world model on release. The methods have different characteristics regarding necessitated vergence switches and afforded cursor control. We performed an experiment in which users draw on two different real-world objects at different distances using the different methods. Results indicate that Surface-Drawing is more accurate than Air-Drawing and Beautified annotations are drawn faster than Non-Beautified; participants also preferred Surface-Drawing and Beautified.",

            "Abstract": "A limiting factor of current smart glasses-based augmented reality (AR) systems is their small field of view. AR assistance systems designed for tasks such as order picking or manual assembly are supposed to guide the visual attention of the user towards the item that is relevant next. This is a challenging task, as the user may initially be in an arbitrary position and orientation relative to the target. As a result of the small field of view, in most cases the target will initially not be covered by the AR display, even if it is visible to the user. This raises the question of how to design attention guiding for such &quot;off-screen gaze&quot; conditions.  The central idea put forward in this paper is to display cues for attention guidance in a way that they can still be followed using peripheral vision. While the eyes&#039; focus point is beyond the AR display, certain visual cues presented on the display are still detectable by the human. In addition to that, guidance methods that are adaptive to the eye movements of the user are introduced and evaluated.  In the frame of a research project on smart glasses-based assistance systems for a manual assembly station, several attention guiding techniques with and without eye tracking have been designed, implemented and tested. As evaluation method simulated AR in a virtual reality HMD setup was used, which supports a repeatable and highly-controlled experimental design.",

            "Abstract": "Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) allows a user, or a group of users, to benefit from digital augmentations embedded directly into the physical world. This enables co-located information and unobstructed interaction. On the other hand, SAR suffers from limitations that are inherently linked to its physical dependency, which is not the case for see-through or immersive displays. In this work, we explore how to facilitate the transition from SAR to VR, and vice versa, integrating both into a unified experience. We developed a set of interaction techniques and obtained first feedback from informal interviews.",

From the premise that simultaneous control over navigation and manipulation by the user can make interaction complex, this technique places two users in asymmetric viewpoint positions during the cooperative manipulation of an object, allowing one of them to follow the object. It applies the separation of degrees of freedom method between the two viewpoints to make the manipulation easier. The technique is evaluated through a user study to test its efficiency on handling cooperative manipulation. Results indicate that, for manipulation tasks that require high amplitude position control along precise orientation control, the technique performs with a lower collisions to time ratio.",

Our research aims to understand the potential for interactive virtual reality (VR) in eliciting awe, through a framework based on collection of physiological data alongside self-report and phenomenological observations that demonstrate awe. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment to test whether VR is effective in eliciting awe, and if this effect might be modulated by the type of natural interaction in the form of a “flight” lounger vs. “standing”. Results demonstrate both interaction paradigms were equally awe-inspiring, with overall physiological (in the form of goose bumps with a 43.8% incidence rate) and self-report data (overall awe rating of 79.7%), and females showing more physiological signs of awe than males. Observations revealed 360-degree interaction and operability of hand-held controllers could be improved, with the consequence of designing even more effective transformative experiences.",

Previous research has shown the benefits of reference frames in maintaining spatial orientation. Here, we propose using a visually simulated reference frame in virtual reality to provide users with a better sense of direction in landmark-free virtual environments. Visually overlaid rectangular frames simulate different variations of frames of reference. We investigated how two different types of visually simulated reference frames might benefit in a navigational search task through a mixed-method study. Results showed that the presence of a reference frame significantly affects participants’ performance in a navigational search task. Though the egocentric frame of reference (simulated CAVE) that translates with the observer did not significantly help, an allocentric frame of reference (a simulated stationary room) significantly improved user performance both in navigational search time and overall travel distance. Our study suggests that adding a variation of the reference frame to virtual reality applications might be a cost-effective solution to enable more effective locomotion in virtual reality.",

We confirmed that a real object with a movable portion (CG) is perceived lighter by MR visual stimulation. Here, we analyze whether the difference in the mass of real objects affects the R-V Dynamics Illusion. We conducted experiments to determine the difference threshold of weights under the condition where the masses of real objects are 500, 750, and 1000g, and only the CG liquid level is changed. As a result, the difference in mass did not influence the difference threshold of weights by changing the virtual liquid level. On the other hand, with the same mass conditions, the difference threshold of weights becomes smaller when the R-V Dynamics Illusion occurs.",

We researched how they explore a realistic 3D environment in Virtual Reality (VR) through archaeometry conventional techniques. Our objective is to evaluate users experiences with interactive archaeometry tools with archaeologist (not a VR expert) and compare results with VR experts (not an archeology expert). Two hypothesis will be tested: a) it’s possible to simulate the virtual world realistically as the real one?; b) if this VR model is passive of exploration, is it possible to create 3DUI analytical tools to help archaeologist to manipulate archaeometry tools? To explore these hypotheses we conducted experimental tests with ten users and the results are promising.",

We hypothesized that a higher level of immersion and involvement in a VR disability simulation that leads to a high sense of presence will help the user improve information recall. We conducted a between subjects experiment in which participants were presented information about multiple sclerosis (MS) in different immersive conditions and afterwards they attempted to recall the information. The results from our study suggest that participants who were in immersive conditions were able to recall the information more effectively than the participants who experienced a non-immersive condition.",

We used gaze-based raycasting and headsets in a low-cost head-mounted display (HMD) (GearVR); and a virtual wand, head tracking, and headsets in a CAVE, two somewhat opposing technologies in the spectrum of current VR systems. Visual rendering and the selection technique depend on the capabilities of each environment, whereas the sound is approximated in both environments. Results show that subjects can select similar seats but their decisions differ between both environments. The results obtained can be useful in guiding the development of future VR applications.",

Avoiding collisions with the physical walls necessitates a system to warn users. This paper describes the design and implementation of a multi-phase warning system as a solution to this safety necessity. The first phase is a velocity-based warning based on time-to-impact. The second phase is distance-based and designed as an emergency warning. Combinations of acoustic and visual feedback mechanisms were tested in a study with 13 participants. The quantitative measures show that the system keeps users safe, while allowing them to freely explore the virtual environment.",

Most commercial applications use some form of teleportation or physical walking for moving around in a virtual space. However, teleportation can be disorienting, due to the sudden change in the environment when teleported to another location. Physical walking techniques are more physically demanding, leading to fatigue. Hence, we explore the use of two spatial controllers that accompany commercial headsets to walk by taking a virtual step each time a controller trigger is pulled. The user has the choice of using the orientation of a single-controller, the average of both controllers, or that of the head to determine the direction of walking, and speed can be controlled by changing the angle of the controller to the Frontal plane.",

We manipulated the stereo and head tracking in four conditions and we examined effects of the two factors on distance perception (room dimensions, habitability, etc.), task difficulty, presence and simulator sickness. Results reveal a significant effect of the stereo on the estimation of the habitability, the dimensions of the rooms and task difficulty. However, the effect of stereo and head tracking was not significant on the presence and simulator sickness.",

            "Abstract": "Social virtual reality (VR) has enormous potential to allow several physically separated users to collaborate in an immersive virtual environment (IVE). These users and their actions are represented by avatars in the IVE. In question is how the appearance of those avatars influences communication and interaction. It might make a difference, if the avatar consists of a complete body representation or if only certain body parts are visible. Moreover, a one-to-one mapping of the user&#039;s movements to the avatar&#039;s movements might have advantages compared to pre-defined avatar animations. To answer these questions, we compared three different types of avatar appearances in a user study. For this, we used estimations of presence, social presence, and cognitive load. The evaluation showed that motion-controlled avatars with full representation of the avatar body lead to an increased sense of presence. Motion-controlled avatars as well as avatars which have only head and hands visible produced an increased feeling of co-presence and behavioral interdependence. This is interesting, since it states that we do not need a complete avatar body in social VR.",

            "Abstract": "The target picking in 3D volumetric data is a common interaction problem in a variety of domains such as medicine, engineering, and physics. When a user clicks on a 2D point on the screen rendering, the ray is cast through the volume at an angle perpendicular to the screen. The problem lies in determining the intended location of picking, that is the end point of the ray. We introduce picking for 3D volumetric data by utilizing pressure and angle of the digital stylus pen on a touchscreen device. We map both pressure and angle of the stylus to the depth of the selector widget to help target acquisition. We evaluate several methods of selection: single finger selection, stylus with pressure but without an angle, and stylus with both angle and pressure. We decouple rotation of the volumetric data, and control for two target sizes. We report significant benefits of digital stylus picking methods and a relation between the methods and target sizes.",

Techniques proposed to overcome such limitations often follow arm-extension metaphors or favor the use of selection volumes combined with ray-casting. Nonetheless, these approaches work for room sized and sparse environments, and they do not scale to larger scenarios with many objects. We introduce PRECIOUS, a novel mid-air technique for selecting out-of-reach objects. It employs an iterative progressive refinement, using cone-casting to select multiple objects and moving users closer to them in each step, allowing accurate selections. A user evaluation showed that PRECIOUS compares favorably against existing approaches, being the most versatile.",

To take advantage of this aspect, we have developed a technique for pseudo-telekinetic object manipulation in VR using slight downward tilt of the head to simulate Jedi concentration. This telekinetic ability draws inspiration from The Force abilities exhibited in the Star Wars universe, and is particularly well suited to VR because it provides the ability to interact with and manipulate objects at a distance. We implemented force translate, force rotate, force push and force pull behaviours as examples of the general concept of force extension. We conducted exploratory user testing to assess telekinesis as a suitable interaction metaphor. Subject performance and feedback varied between participants but were generally encouraging.",

            "Abstract": "In many virtual reality applications, it would be ideal if users could use their physical hands to directly interact with virtual objects while experiencing realistic haptic feedback. While this can be achieved via interaction with tracked physical props that correspond to virtual objects, practical limitations can make it difficult to achieve a physical environment that exactly represents the virtual world, and virtual environments are often much larger than the available tracked physical space. Our approach maps a single physical prop to multiple virtual objects distributed throughout a virtual environment. Additionally, our work explores scenarios using one physical prop to control multiple types of object interactions. We explore considerations that allow physical object manipulation using orientation resetting to physically align the user with a physical prop for interaction. The resetting approach applies a discrete positional and rotational update to the user&#039;s location when the user virtually approaches a target for interaction, and the redirected reach approach applies a translational offset to the user’s virtual hand based on the positional difference of the virtual and physical objects.",

We propose a system and a 3D interaction technique for controlling indoor lights. The system is extendable and supports multiple users to control lights using either gestures or a GUI. Using a single Kinect sensor, the user is able to control lights from different positions in the room while standing or sitting down within the tracking range of the sensor. The selection and manipulation accuracy of the proposed technique together with the ease of use compared to other alternatives makes it a promising lighting control technique.",

            "Abstract": "We address a 3D pointing problem for a &quot;virtual mirror&quot; view used in collaborative VR. The virtual mirror is a large TV display showing a depth-camera-based image of a user in a surrounding virtual environment. There are problems with pointing and communicating to remote users due to the indirectness of pointing in a mirror and a low sense of depth. We propose several visual cues to help the user control pointing depth, and present an initial user study, providing a basis for further refinement and investigation of techniques.",

            "Abstract": "Accommodative depth cues, a wide field of view, and ever-higher resolutions all present major hardware design challenges for near-eye displays. Optimizing a design to overcome one of these challenges typically leads to a trade-off in the others. We tackle this problem by introducing an all-in-one solution – a new wide field of view, gaze-tracked near-eye display for augmented reality applications. The key component of our solution is the use of a single see-through, varifocal deformable membrane mirror for each eye reflecting a display. They are controlled by airtight cavities and change the effective focal power to present a virtual image at a target depth plane which is determined by the gaze tracker. The benefits of using the membranes include wide field of view (100° diagonal) and fast depth switching (from 20 cm to infinity within 300 ms). Our subjective experiment verifies the prototype and demonstrates its potential benefits for near-eye see-through displays.",

            "Abstract": "Modern virtual reality simulations require a constant high-frame rate from the rendering engine. They may also require very low latency and stereo images. Previous rendering engines for virtual reality applications have exploited spatial and temporal coherence by using image-warping to re-use previous frames or to render a stereo pair at lower cost than running the full render pipeline twice. However these previous approaches have shown artifacts or have not scaled well with image size. We present a new image-warping algorithm that has several novel contributions: an adaptive grid generation algorithm for proxy geometry for image warping; a low-pass hole-filling algorithm to address un-occlusion; and support for transparent surfaces by efficiently ray casting transparent fragments stored in per-pixel linked lists of an A-Buffer. We evaluate our algorithm with a variety of challenging test cases. The results show that it achieves better quality image-warping than state-of-the-art techniques and that it can support transparent surfaces effectively. Finally, we show that our algorithm can achieve image warping at rates suitable for practical use in a variety of applications on modern virtual reality equipment.",

            "Abstract": "Motion-to-photon latency causes images to sway from side to side in a VR/AR system, while display persistence causes smearing; both of these are undesirable artifacts. We show that once latency is reduced or eliminated, smearing due to display persistence becomes the dominant visual artifact, even with accurate tracker prediction. We investigate the human perceptual mechanisms responsible for this and we demonstrate a modified 3D rotation display controller architecture for driving a high speed digital display which minimizes latency and persistence. We simulate it in software and we built a testbench based on a very high frame rate (2880 fps 1-bit images) display system mounted on a mechanical rotation gantry which emulates display rotation during head rotation in an HMD.",

Researching deeply about Virtual Reality during that period, Lionel realised this emerging technology could be the game-changer for media and content, and thus - quit his job, packed his bag and uprooted himself and his family to move to London to pursue a Masters degree in Creative Technology; specialising in Augmented and Virtual Reality. There, he produced London’s first ever 360 Virtual Reality Dance staged at Middlesex University and also Singapore Inside out (London) a VR experience (​www.sgiolondon.com)​ for the the touring exhibition by Singapore Tourism Board. After completing and achieving distinction in his postgraduate studies, he returned to Singapore and immediately became a much sought after consultant and speaker in the fields of Virtual Reality.     In his current position as Creative Technologist for his startup, iMMERSiVELY (​www.immersively.co​) with offices in both Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia - he is looking forwards to bring this exciting technology to various industries, and across the rest of Asia.",

In 2001, I was appointed as a research assistant and the manager of the Laboratory for Experimental Economics at the University of Erfurt, where I gained my doctoral degree in 2007. In May 2013, I joined RWTH Aachen University as Professor of Experimental Economics. My main research topics are cooperation in social dilemmas and organizations, and leadership. I use Virtual Reality technologies to conduct novel behavioral experiments, to answer a variety of economic questions, e.g. peer effects, intercultural trust etc.",

Technological developments in the context of information and communication technology, especially miniaturization, novel wireless communication options, and the increased processing power per die area lead to more and more embedded systems that are interconnected with each other and exchanging data amongst each other to provide novel services. These distributed systems either directly and autonomously exchange data in the sense of machine-to-machine communication or are interacting with a human users in the sense of human-computer interaction. I am investigating research questions in the area of mobile and embedded systems, the Internet of Things and in the area of novel user interfaces for post-desktop systems.          Since March 2013, I am full professor and heading the &quot;Lehrstuhl für Informatik mit Schwerpunkt Eingebettete Systeme&quot; (Institute for Embedded Systems&quot;) at the &quot;Fakultät für Informatik und Mathematik&quot; (Faculty for Informatics and Mathematics) at the &quot;Universität Passau&quot; (University of Passau).",

            "Bio": "I am a senior researcher (Directeur de Recherche) in Computer Science with a rich experience in industry and academia in France and North America. I graduated from Mines Paris Tech in 1986, where I also got my PhD in 1991. I have conducted research in a variety of domains, from geometric design to 3D animation and computer vision. I was an expert in the international MPEG group from 1997 to 2000. In 2007, I joined Xtranormal Technologies in Montreal, where I became R&#38;D director for virtual cinematography. My team created the patented “magicam” system, which was used to produce two million user-generated animation movies.     I came back to INRIA in 2009 with a new research program devoted to “directing virtual worlds”. I helped to create the IMAGINE team in 2012, focusing on the “narrative design” part of the project. Towards this goal, I investigate computational models of visual storytelling and movie-making. I have co-chaired international workshops on 3-D cinematography (New York City, 2006; Banff, 2008; Providence, 2012), intelligent cinematography and editing (Quebec, 2014; Zurich, 2015; Lisbon, 2016, Lyon 2017 and computational models of narratives (Atlanta, 2015, Krakow, 2016). I am the scientific leader of the IMAGINE team since May 2016.",
