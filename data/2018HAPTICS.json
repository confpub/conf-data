            "Abstract": "How sensitive is the neck in distinguishing two points of contact? The current study was performed to gain insight about the spatial acuity of the neck in hopes of using this information in future research and development of tactile devices targeting this area of the body. Using a two-point orientation discrimination task, a relatively novel measure of spatial sensitivity, the threshold of eight locations around the circumference of the neck was measured. Results showed uniform sensitivity in seven of the eight locations, with a slightly lower threshold at the very front of the neck. These results indicate that the neck could be a viable location to effectively communicate tactile information in a uniform fashion.",

            "Abstract": "The development of epidermal electronics provides an enabling means for continuous monitoring of physiological signals and physical activities without affecting the quality of life. Such devices require high sensitivity for low-magnitude signal detection, noise reduction for motion artifacts, wearability for long-term comfort, and low-cost production for scalable manufacturing. However, the current epidermal pressure sensing devices, usually involving complex multilayer structures, have not fully addressed the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we have presented a novel epidermal iontronic sensing (EIS) device, that is, a novel wearable pressure sensor with a single-sided configuration and reversible attachability to human skin. Notably, incorporating skin as part of the sensing architecture, the EIS devices offer an excellent pressure sensitivity (5 nF/kPa), an ultrafast mechanical response (in a sub-millisecond range), and a good long-term stability (&#62;10,000) for both internal (body) and external (environment) mechanical stimuli. Demonstrations of its versatile application to wearable scenarios include measuring blood pressure pulsations, monitoring respiration rates, tracking muscle activities, and digitalizing hand palpation and gripping.",

            "Abstract": "We present a robotic setup for the acquisition of object surface material properties. Our setup is able to collect selected kinesthetic characteristics, such as the surface structure and weight, as well as tactile properties like the friction coefficient and the fine roughness characteristics of the object surface. Additionally, the setup captures the visual appearances of the object. The recorded multimodal sensor data provide all relevant information required to form a haptic model of a material sample. We then use this representation in a standard haptic rendering framework and display the virtual materials using an augmented Phantom Omni device. We conducted a subjective experiment which shows that its participants perceived and rated the rendered virtual materials as similar to the corresponding real materials in a direct comparison test where the users interact simultaneously with the real and the virtual material samples. An overall user rating of 4.3 out of 5.0 is achieved during the subjective experiment.",

            "Abstract": "The objective of the present research was to determine how variations in the signals generated by different vibrotactile actuators are perceived and which features are judged as being distinctive. For this purpose, three different types of actuator were used to generate signals that varied in amplitude, waveform and frequency. Participants were required to judge the degree of similarity-dissimilarity between pairs of stimuli. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques were then used as an exploratory data analysis technique to create a spatial map that depicted the relations among the various vibrotactile signals. The first dimension that emerged from the MDS represented a continuum associated with transitions in the amplitudes of the signals, with a smooth sine wave pattern contrasting with the more abrupt transitions in square waves. This may be considered a smooth-rough dimension. The second dimension extracted from the data was more difficult to characterize in that each of the two clusters along this dimension involved signals of varying waveform and frequency. Further work will aim at defining the perceptual qualities of this dimension.",

            "Abstract": "Haptic rendering is typically done through either impedance or admittance devices, which exist at opposite ends of a spectrum from light direct-drive to non-backdrivable highly geared. The device hardware necessarily influences what the user will feel, particularly at high frequencies. While human motion is generally limited to 10Hz, virtual environments with contact transitions have the potential to excite a wider frequency spectrum.  We employ the effective impedance decomposition to discuss the effects of hardware and controller selection outside of the rendering bandwidth. We also introduce an analysis of the admittance and impedance controllers with respect to sensitivity to load cell noise. Using a reconfigurable admittance/impedance device and a perceptual experiment, we explore these effects. We find that higher effective mass outside the rendering bandwidth leads to more confusion in discriminating springs in an admittance device than an impedance device.",

In prior studies to invoke pseudo-haptics on the touch panel, there has been a problem stemming from the difference in position between the finger and the object. We added the virtual string on display which shows a connection between the finger and the object. The user studies showed that the presence of the virtual string was effective to invoke pseudo-haptics, and the setting of string breaks was key to enhance the effect of it.",

Based on the unilateral deformable features of the strain-limiting layer in the soft actuator, the dorsal-side mounting solution along with a light-weighted linkage mechanism is proposed to produce fingertip force feedback. We applied a pre-deformation of the soft actuator to enable the back drivability and the free space sensation. We then implemented a physical prototype of a two-fingered glove. Experimental results show that the glove could achieve considerable performance in free space with small frictional force (0.58N in maximum). While simulating the constrained space, the fingertip force reaches up to 2.1N. For the future work, we plan to improve the current solution to five fingers with finger position tracking and distributed tactile sensing on the palm.",

            "Abstract": "The present study investigated the perceptual dimensions associated with manual key clicks, with the goal of developing realistic haptic key-click feedback signals for virtual keys. We first harvested eight adjective pairs for describing the haptic feel of button and key presses from native English speakers. We then conducted the main experiment where participants provided adjective ratings and grouping data for twenty-three buttons and keys. An MDS analysis of the grouping data led to either a 2-D or 3-D solution. By projecting adjective ratings onto the MDS solution spaces, we found the 2-D perceptual space to be an adequate representation of human perception of manual key clicks. The two perceptual dimensions are determined to be shallow-deep and rough-smooth. Future work will explore the physical parameters corresponding to the perceptual dimensions and ways to simulate realistic key clicks by designing feedback signals using the relevant parameters.",

It can achieve a strong active lateral force (400 mN) on the bare fingertip while operating silently. The lateral force is a function of pressing force, lateral vibration velocity, and electroadhesive voltage, as well as the relative phase between the velocity and voltage. In this paper, we perform experiments to investigate characteristics of the UltraShiver and their influence on lateral force.",

To this end, we tested subjects&#39; ability to perceptually match a reference texture containing two spatial frequency components by adjusting the frequency and amplitude of a single frequency. All textures consisted of spatially varied friction levels on a glass display screen, where friction was modulated via amplitude of ultrasonic vibrations. Resulting chosen single frequencies were systematic, and suggest subjects can identify a single frequency, or tactile pitch, falling somewhere between those of the reference texture. Subject-adjusted frequency is modeled as a function of the reference texture&#39;s frequency components and the ratio of their amplitudes.",

            "Abstract": "Alongside questions of how to create haptic effects on displays via alternative hardware, recent work has explored rendering options with respect to haptic effects, i.e. when and where to provide haptic feedback. In particular, recent work by Zhang and Harrison for electrostatic haptic feedback noted that the optimal technique for haptic feedback during interaction is the Fill technique, where haptic effects are rendered at all times when a user&#39;s finger is within the bounds of the target. In this paper, we explore whether this result generalizes to an alternative haptic rendering technology that uses ultrasonic vibrations to create haptic sensations, a technique called the ``Squeeze Film Effect&#39;&#39;. In contrast to prior work, our results indicate that positioning the haptic feedback as a discrete linear stimulus centred on the target provides an optimal trade-off between speed, accuracy, and user preference. We highlight the implications of this work to the generalizability of haptic feedback: Haptic feedback can improve time, errors, and user satisfaction during interaction, but only if the correct form of feedback is used for the specific haptic effect generated by the hardware.",

Despite this fact, these sensors are not used to their full potential. This illustrates the need for low-cost, versatile tactile sensors. In this paper we introduce novel robotic fingertips that use low-cost components coupled with mechanical ingenuity in order to attain important and high-quality tactile data. Our robotic fingertips contain a rolling mechanism, and can sense the force applied to an object, the normal direction of the contact point, as well as parallel movement along the object&#39;s surface. We show three main uses for this fingertip. Firstly, we demonstrate how the fingertips can be used for the detection of soft or lightweight objects by applying extremely small forces to them. Secondly, we present a method of full-perimeter definition (location and normal direction) of rigid objects by tracing. Lastly, we explain how our sensors can be used to detect stiffness and stiffness anomalies in soft objects, such as organic tissue.",

We qualitatively and quantitatively examine the properties of the skin, body, surface coating, and various electrode interface impedances in isolation using different contact interface conditions and measurement types. A lumped series impedance model explains how all impedances are related during normal usage, and the linearity of this model is shown to be valid under certain assumptions, such as high applied frequencies or small applied currents. Speculation as to the physical mechanisms underlying each impedance element is also given. This analysis unambiguously verifies the existence of a previously hypothesized key electrical system parameter: the sliding interfacial impedance (or air gap impedance). This parameter represents the large increase (100-1000 percent) in overall electrical impedance observed when a finger is sliding versus when it is stationary. It is concluded that this impedance increase cannot be explained by other measured electrical impedance elements in the system and that it vanishes again when the finger comes to rest.",

Various kinds of sensors have been studied with various technologies for the sensing of external stimuli. Tactile sensors using capacitive, piezoresistive, piezoelectric and pyroelectric mechanism have been suggested to sense pressure, vibration and temperature. Unfortunately, it is rare to find a studying results of tactile sensor related with a surface information detection in comparison with pressure and temperature sensing. The ability to sense a surface information is the important factor to distinguish surface feelings such as roughness and smoothness. In this paper, a sensor array using piezoelectricity is demonstrated with a sliding motion to sense surface information such as the pitch and width of surface features. The suggested sensor array has a high spatial resolution(500um) and detected the variable sliding speeds thanks to the excellent dynamic response of the piezoelectric material. The reconfigured surface information had high accuracy compared to actual one. The demonstrated sliding speed sensing, high spatial resolution and the pitch and width of surface features measurement capabilities allow the sensor to be utilized as an intelligent artificial tactile sensor.",

            "Abstract": "Touching an object with our fingers yields frictional forces that allow us to perceive and explore its texture, shape, and other features. While the relevance of these frictional forces to sensory and motor function in the hand is well established, the way that they reflect the shape and texture of touched objects is not well understood. This lack of knowledge currently constraints the development of haptic rendering algorithms that rely on reproducing frictional forces to mimic the sensation of touching real surfaces. To address this, we created a low order contact mechanics inspired model that accounted for: disconnection between the finger and high relief features of the surfaces, and differences of pressure applied in the contact regions. The output of our model was compared to experimental frictional force measurements of bare-fingers sliding on structured surfaces. The results show high similarity between the measurements and the model output. The model presented can be used to predict frictional forces if the geometry of a touched surface is known together with the coefficient of friction of the untextured surface.",

            "Abstract": "With the introduction of variable friction displays, new possibilities have emerged in haptic texture rendering on flat surfaces. In this work, we propose a data-driven method for realistic texture rendering on an electrovibration display. We first describe a motorized linear tribometer we developed to collect lateral frictional forces from the textured surfaces under various scanning velocities and normal forces. We then propose an inverse dynamics model of the display to describe its output input relationship using nonlinear autoregressive with external input (NARX) neural networks. Forces resulting from applying a pseudo-random binary signal (PRBS) to the display are used to train each network under the given experimental condition. A comparison between the real and virtual forces in frequency domain shows promising results for recreating virtual textures similar to the real ones and also reveals the capabilities and limitations of the proposed method.",

            "Abstract": "Due, in part, to the popularity of online shopping, there is considerable interest in enabling consumers to experience material touch via internet connected devices. While there have been several efforts to render texture via electrostatic tactile displays, the textures involved have typically consisted of synthetic patterns, such as shapes, shadings, or gradients of photographic textures. In this paper, we propose a data-driven algorithm for the haptic rendering of fabric textures on an electrostatic tactile display. We measure the friction force, normal force, and displacement during the swiping of a finger across real fabric using a new measurement apparatus introduced here. Using these measurements, we compute friction coefficients derived from the recorded frictional and normal forces. We then reproduce the friction coefficients by controlling the voltage applied to an electrostatic tactile display in order to render the tactile texture of the measured fabric. In order to evaluate this rendering method, we conducted a psychophysical experiment that assessed the visual and haptic similarity of ten real and simulated fabrics. The experimental results show that the virtual textures generated using this electrostatic rendering algorithm were perceptually similar to the corresponding real textures for all fabrics tested, underlining the promise of electrostatic tactile displays for material simulation.",

            "Abstract": "The influence of the vibration frequency on the friction reduction of an ultrasonic haptic surface has been reported in the literature. The models predict that increasing the frequency of the vibration leads to higher friction reduction at constant vibration amplitude, but this has not been reported experimentally. In this paper, we study the friction reduction on a prototype which can vibrate at low (66kHz) and high (225kHz) frequency. By estimating the Point of Subjective Equivalence between a standard at low frequency with a sample at high frequency, we have found that high frequencies can indeed reduce the friction, with the advantage of much smaller vibration amplitude. Moreover, we show that the invariant between the two frequency conditions is not the vibration amplitude. Our conclusion is that the invariant could be the acceleration instead.",

            "Abstract": "To accurately reproduce a sense of compliance in tactile displays, we must understand the physics of how the finger pad skin deforms. To this end, we developed a stereo imaging technique to visualize the skin through optically clear stimuli. The method achieves a 3-D spatial resolution of 60-120 microns and temporal resolution of 30 frames per second. With human subjects, we measured the skin’s deformation over a range of compliances (61-266 kPa), displacements (0-4 mm), and velocities (1- 15 mm/s). The method can differentiate patterns of skin deformation between compliances, as defined by new metrics such as surface penetration depth.",

            "Abstract": "Touch is an essential method for communicating emotions between individuals. Humans use a variety of different gestures to convey these emotions, including squeezes, pats, and strokes. This paper presents a device for creating a continuous lateral motion on the arm to mimic a subset of the gestures used in social touch. The device is composed of a linear array of voice coil actuators that is embedded in a fabric sleeve. The voice coils are controlled to sequentially press into the user&#39;s arm to create the sensation of linear travel up the arm. We evaluate the device in a human-subject study to confirm that a linear lateral motion can be created using only normal force, and to determine the optimal actuation parameters for creating a continuous and pleasant sensation. The results of the study indicated that the voice coils should be controlled with a long duration for each indentation and a short delay between the onset of indentation between adjacent actuators to maximize both continuity and pleasantness.",

            "Abstract": "In the design of a haptic device, it is difficult to achieve simultaneously high stiffness and low friction and inertia. In our previous research, we proposed a co-actuation method to overcome this difficulty. The method uses a physical constraint to simulate hard contact and allows the device move freely in free motion space by keeping a clearance between the physical constraint and the link of the device. A stiffness of 40N/mm and back-driving friction of less than 0.3N have been achieved in a co-actuation module of one degree-of-freedom (DOF) using an electromagnetic motor and gear reducer. However, the stiffness is not high sufficient (10N/mm) at the initial contact due to the backlash in the transmission. In this paper, we explore the possibility to use an ultrasonic motor (USM) for solving this problem. Compared with the electromagnetic motor used in the early design, the USM is able to generate a larger resistant torque without gearbox, at a fast rate. We develop a model to determine the maximum clearance between the physical constraint and the link. We verify the clearance model and the force feedback performance using a one DOF haptic device. The experimental results show that the device achieves a stiffness of 61.5N/mm and back-driving friction less than 0.4N, which implies that the USM is promising for achieving both high stiffness and low friction and inertia required by the haptic application.",

            "Abstract": "Skin stretch haptic devices are well-suited for transmitting information through touch, a promising avenue in prosthetic research, addressing the lack of feedback in myoelectric designs. Rocker-based skin stretch devices have been proposed for sensory substitution and navigational feedback, but the designs vary in their geometry. Other works create torsional stretch, and utilize nonlinear mappings to enhance perception. This work investigates parameters of rocker geometry and mapping functions, and how they impact user perception. We hypothesize that perceptual changes are dependent on the choice of stretch increment sizes over the range of motion. The rocker geometry is varied with an offset between the rotational and geometric axes, and three rocker designs are evaluated during a targeting task implemented with a nonlinear or linear mapping. The rockers with no offset and a positive offset (wide) perform better than the negative offset (narrow) case, though the mapping method does not affect target accuracy.",

            "Abstract": "While many wearable tactile displays for the fingers, such as fingertip-type and glove-type displays, have been developed, their weight and size typically hinder the free movement of fingers, especially when considering the multi-finger scenario. We propose a method of presenting the haptics sensation of the fingertip on the forearm, not on the fingertip, to address this issue. A five-bar linkage mechanism was adopted to present a two-degree-of-freedom force. We conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, we presented a pressure sensation and a horizontal friction sensation perceived by the index finger to multiple sites of the forearm to search for a proper location of presentation, finding that the volar part of the wrist is optimal. On the basis of this result, we developed a device for the index finger and thumb, and conducted a second experiment to present the grasping force in a virtual reality environment. The realism of the experience in virtual reality was better when using the designed device than for no haptics cue or for vibration conditions.",

            "Abstract": "A damped sinusoidal vibration is generally used to reproduce the sensation of tapping. However, the type of actuator generally used in the field of tactile display cannot produce very low-frequency vibrations, and thus cannot activate Merkel cells to produce the sensation of cutaneous pressure. In this study we propose a method that combines cathodic electrical stimulation, which produces a pressure-like sensation, with a mechanical damped sinusoidal vibration. Our experiment demonstrated that the cutaneous pressure sensation produced by cathodic electrical stimulation mostly affects the perception of softness, allowing our method to reproduce sensations of softness/hardness over a wider range than when using mechanical vibration alone. Most participants felt that the combination of these two stimulations provided a more realistic tapping sensation.",

We adopt photometric stereo, one of the most accurate algorithms for 3D surface reconstruction, to increase the resolution of captured geometry profiles. This benefit of higher texture resolution can enhance the realism of rendered textures in terms of roughness. To this end, we have designed and constructed a dome-shaped lighting structure for use in the modeling using photometric stereo. With this apparatus and the photometric stereo algorithms, we can achieve very high texture modeling resolution in the order of 10 mm. We also identify the stiffness and friction of real materials using the Hunt-Crossley model and the Dahl model, respectively, for realistic texture rendering. A user study measuring the perceived similarity between real and virtual textures demonstrated that our system can achieve a reasonably high level of realism in rendering textured objects with high compliance or low friction.",

            "Abstract": "Our sensorimotor system estimates stiffness to form stiffness perception, such as for choosing a ripe fruit, and to generate actions, such as to adjust grip force to avoid slippage of a scalpel during surgery. We examined how temporal manipulation of the haptic and visual feedback affect stiffness perception and grip force adjustment during a stiffness discrimination task. We used delayed force feedback and delayed visual feedback to break the natural relations between these modalities when participants tried to choose the harder spring between pairs of springs. We found that visual delay caused participants to slightly overestimate stiffness while force feedback delay caused a mixed effect on perception; for some it caused underestimation and for some overestimation of stiffness. Interestingly and in contrast to previous findings without vision, we found that participants increased the magnitude of their applied grip force for all conditions. We propose a model that suggests that this increase was a result of coupling the grip force adjustment to their proprioceptive hand position, which was the only modality which we could not delay. Our findings shed light on how the sensorimotor system combines information from different sensory modalities for perception and action. These results are important for the design of improved teleoperation systems that suffer from unavoidable delays.",

Although a noncontact heat display using infrared rays has been reported, such an infrared display cannot cool the skin surface. In this study, we generate and control a straight, thin, long, air flow driven by an ultrasound-phased array and transport cold air to a localized spot on the users’ skin. Since the air flow position and direction is electronically steerable, the display area can be controlled freely. A prototype of the proposed display was developed and the cooling performance was evaluated. We confirm that a small cool spot is created and shifted on a user’s forearm based on our observations of the temporal changes in the skin temperature distribution using thermography.",

            "Abstract": "Abstract— Surgery is a challenging domain for motor skill acquisition, and compounding this difficulty is the often delayed and qualitative nature of feedback that is provided to trainees. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of providing real-time feedback of movement smoothness, a characteristic associated with skilled and coordinated movement, via a vibrotactile cue. Subjects performed a mirror-tracing task that requires coordination and dexterity similar in nature to that required in endovascular surgery. Movement smoothness, measured by spectral arc length, a frequency-domain measure of movement smoothness, was encoded in a vibrotactile cue. Performance of the mirror tracing task with smoothness-based feedback was compared to position-based feedback (where the subject was alerted when they moved outside the path boundary) and to a no-feedback control condition. Although results of this pilot study failed to indicate a statistically significant effect of smoothness-based feedback on performance, subjects receiving smoothness-based feedback altered their task completion strategies to improve speed and accuracy, while those receiving position-based feedback or no feedback only improved in terms of increased accuracy. In tasks such as surgery where both speed and accuracy are vital to positive patient outcomes, the provision of smoothness-based feedback to the surgeon has the potential to positively influence performance.",

            "Abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven thermal rendering framework for highly realistic re-creation of the thermal dynamics of real objects in a virtual environment. We begin with a physics-based model for thermal rendering and then extend it to compute the desired temperature of a thermal display without identification of the thermal parameters of real objects. Our approach is data-driven: we collect the thermal responses between hand and object for many different combinations of the initial temperatures of hand and object and then interpolate several real thermal responses to render virtual thermal stimuli with the target initial temperatures. We also present perceptual evaluation results obtained in a discrimination experiment and a (preliminary) identification experiment, which both advocated the adequacy of our data-driven thermal rendering framework.",

            "Abstract": "This work presents the development of a novel thermal display for transient heat rendering in virtual environments. The design of the fingertip device focused on the low weight and compactness in order to achieve a high level of wearability and high performance in thermal rendering. The device is intended for integration with the Haptic Thimble device, in order to develop a novel interface for thermal and haptic rendering of virtual surfaces.  An iterative Finite Elements (FE) procedure has been performed within the design process in order to numerically validate the final design of the thermal module. Finally, a thorough experimental characterization has been performed in order to evaluate the dynamic thermal capabilities of the prototype, considering also the finger contact response and the temperature uniformity of the plate in contact with the finger.",

            "Abstract": "We characterize the detection thresholds of subjects holding a stylus with a precision grasp for six principal modes of vibrotactile display: three orthogonal force directions and three orthogonal torque directions. Subjects are far more sensitive to torque signals about the shaft of the stylus than to torque signals orthogonal to it, subjects are less sensitive at low frequencies to force signals parallel to the shaft than to force signals orthogonal to it, and the thresholds for force and torque signals applied orthogonal to the shaft can be approximately equated by considering the reaction moment felt at the grasp point.",

            "Abstract": "This work presents an exploratory user study of human-to-robot handovers. In particular, it examines how changes in a robot behaviour influence human participation and the overall interaction. With a 2x2x2 experimental design, we vary three basic factors and observe both the interaction position and forces. We find the robot&#39;s initial pose can inform the giver about the upcoming handover geometry and impact fluency and efficiency. Also we find variations in grasp method and retraction speed induce significantly different interaction forces. This effect may occur by changing the giver&#39;s perception of object safety and hence their release timing. Alternatively, it may stem from unnatural or mismatched robot movements. We determine that making the robot predictable is important: we observe a learning effect with forces declining over repeated trials. Simultaneously, the participants&#39; self-reported discomfort with the robot decreases and perception of emotional warmth increases. Thus, we posit users are learning to predict the robot, becoming more familiar with its behaviours, and perhaps becoming more trusting of the robot&#39;s ability to safely receive the object. We find these results exciting as we believe a robot can become a trusted partner in collaborative tasks.",
